# Introduction

The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, who presented it as a peer-to-peer electronic coin with secured and verified transactions through an encrypted proof-of-work mechanism [@nakamoto2008bitcoin]. As originally proposed, Bitcoin was designed as an alternative, decentralized cash system offering low-cost and near-real-time transactions, while avoiding currency controls imposed by national governments or financial institutions^[Contrary to the common belief, Bitcoin is not anonymous. All Bitcoin transactions are publicly visible in the network and only the identity of the user behind a Bitcoin address is unknown, until their idendity is revealed through a pruchase or another action. See @meiklejohnFistfulBitcoins2013 and https://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know.] [@dwyerEconomicsBitcoin2015]. These features quickly attracted widespread public attention. However, due to its high volatility, researchers have questioned its role as a purely digital currency and instead classified it as an investment or speculative asset [@baurBitcoinMedium2018; @glaserBitcoinAsset2014; @baurVolatilityBitcoin2021].

Since then, the cryptocurrency market has expanded rapidly, giving rise to thousands of new coins. In the second quarter of 2025, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization amounted to nearly 3.5 trillion USD, according to data from @coingecko2025Q2. Despite this rapid growth, perceptions of cryptocurrencies remain divided. Some view them as investments tied to the underlying technologies, such as blockchain and smart contracts, or simply as a form of speculation [@vasudevaCryptocurrencyInvestment2023; @baekBitcoinsInvestment2015]. Others, however, see them as bubbles, fraud schemes, or scams, often driven by internet and social media marketing—for example, rug pulls involving so-called “memecoins,” or, more recently, the LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal in February 2025, when the coin was promoted by Argentinian president Javier Milei, soared in value, and collapsed only a few hours later [@kalachevaDetectingRug2025; @nicasMilei$Melania2025; @yaffe-bellanyDigitalCoin2024].

As mentioned earlier, a key characteristic of cryptocurrencies is their high volatility, which greatly exceeds that of other traditional assets such as equity indices, gold, silver, foreign exchange currencies, and commodities  [@conlonAreCryptocurrencies2020; @kleinBitcoinNot2018]. According to the standard asset pricing theory, investors should be compensated for bearing such risks. The principle that higher risk should be associated with higher expected returns is central in finance, beginning with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of @sharpeCapitalAsset1964 and @lintnerValuationRisk1965, and later extended by @mertonIntertemporalCapital1973, who introduced state variables to capture changes in investment and consumption decisions through the intertemporal CAPM,  and by @rossArbitrageTheory1976, who formalized multi-factor risk pricing through the arbitrage pricing theory (APT). In particular, the APT shows that, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, asset returns can be represented by a linear factor model, where returns are explained by their exposures to systematic risk factors. In empirical applications, this relation is often estimated through time-series regressions [@cochrane2009asset]. Let $r_{i,t+1} \in \mathbb{R}$ denote the excess return on asset $i$ from period $t$ to $t+1$, and let $f_{t+1} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a vector of risk factors. The model can then be written as  
$$
r_{i,t+1} = \alpha_{i,t} + \beta_{i,t}' f_{t+1} + \epsilon_{i,t+1},
$$
where $\beta_{i,t} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ measures the exposure of asset $i$ to the risk factors, $\alpha_{i,t}$ represents a pricing error (equal to zero under correct specification), and $\epsilon_{i,t+1}$ is the idiosyncratic component of returns.

A major challenge of the framework described above is identifying the set of factors that best capture asset returns, as these factors are not directly observable. This raises the question of whether they truly explain the cross-section of excess returns or whether such returns should instead be attributed to asset mispricing. This motivates the main questions addressed in this thesis:

- Which factors account for the variation in cryptocurrency returns? 
- To what extend can the return cross-section be explained by systematic risk factors?
- Does allowing for dynamic factor loadings improve the prediction of cross-sectional excess returns?

The main goal of this thesis is to apply established factor models from the financial literature to a large panel of cryptocurrency data and to compare their predictive performance under static and dynamic loadings. In particular, I replicate the approaches of @kellyCharacteristicsAre2019 and @bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021 for the  cryptocurrency market. The analysis relies on a model that allows factor loadings to vary over time through observable characteristics, using the Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) methodology.

## Literature review

Linear factor pricing models play a fundamental role in the field of finance. Building on the theoretical foundations of APT, a large body of academic research have worked to identify the sources of economic risks and the factors that explain the cross-section of asset returns. Broadly speaking, two main strands have emerged in the empirical literature [@kellyCharacteristicsAre2019]. 

One strand of the literature pre-specifies the factors $f_{t+1}$ and represents them with long-short portfolios, often referred to as  factor-mimicking portfolios or sorted portfolios. These long-short portfolios are based on well-established knowledge of the empirical behavior of asset returns and are therefore treated as fully observable [@kellyCharacteristicsAre2019]. The main drawback of this approach is that it presumes a prior understanding of the cross-sectional dynamics of asset returns, even though such knowledge is incomplete or imperfect. 

Although the construction of each factor varies across studies, the process typically involves sorting assets into quintiles (or deciles) based on a given characteristic and forming the factor return as the difference between the top and bottom groups. @famaCommonRisk1993 were the first to formalize this approach in the context of linear factor models, introducing a three-factor model (FF3) that included the market, size, and value factors to explain stocks and bond returns. @carhartPersistenceMutual1997 expanded the FF3 by adding a momentum factor, which captures the one-year asset momentum, forming in this way a 4-factor model. Later, @famaFivefactorAsset2015 extended the FF3 by incorporating profitability and investment factors, creating a 5-factor model to capture additional stock return variation beyond size and value.  

The number of risk factors proposed in the literature is vast, with hundreds of them reported across different studies [@cochranePresidentialAddress2011; @harveyLuckyFactors2021]. @fengTamingFactor2020 developed a model selection framework to evaluate the contribution of newly proposed factors, finding that most are redundant relative to existing ones. @houReplicatingAnomalies2020 and @chenOpenSource2021 replicated 452 and 319 long-short strategies from the literature, respectively. Hou et al. failed to reproduce the results of more than half of predictors in their set, finding most of them statistically insignificant and concluding that many published return predictors are not reliable. By contrast, Chen and Zimmerman showed that nearly all of the literature results can be successfully replicated. 

A second strand of research views the factors as latent and applies data-compression techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to simultaneously extract common factors and estimate their betas directly from the panel of realized returns [@bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021]. This method derives factors purely from a statistical criteria and therefore requires no prior knowledge of the cross-sectional behavior of returns. Its main limitation, however, is that PCA can only estimate static loadings, implying that asset exposures to systematic risk are assumed constant over time. Moreover, PCA cannot incorporate additional information beyond returns, which restricts its ability to identify more appropriate asset pricing models [@kellyCharacteristicsAre2019].

The pioneers in this approach are @chamberlainArbitrageFactor1983 and @connorPerformanceMeasurement1986. @chamberlainArbitrageFactor1983 defined the concept of approximate factor structure and showed that asset returns on large markets can be represented by a small number of common factors that can be extracted with PCA, as long as the covariance matrix of asset returns has $K$ unbounded eigenvalues. Building on this, @connorPerformanceMeasurement1986 developed an econometric method using asymptotic principal components that estimates latent factors and their loadings from large panels of returns, providing consistent APT-based performance measures and an application to portfolio evaluation.

More recently, @kellyCharacteristicsAre2019 introduced the Instrumented PCA (IPCA). Unlike PCA, which assumes static factor loadings, IPCA allows loadings to vary with observable asset characteristics such as size, volatility, or momentum. These characteristics serve as instruments for conditional loadings, enabling the method to incorporate more information than returns alone and to handle unbalanced panels of data. @baliJointFactor2023 extended the IPCA approach to a joint factor model that explains the risk-return trade-off across different asset classes --bonds, stocks, and options--. In a related work, @chenCommonRisk2024 proposed the Regressed PCA (RPCA), which extracts common latent factors across stocks, bonds, and options by combining cross-sectional Fama–MacBeth regressions [@famaRiskReturn1973] on asset characteristics with standard PCA.

While most of the literature has focused on understanding stock market returns, a growing body of research has examined the dynamics of cryptocurrency returns. Inspired by the FF3 model in equities, @liuCommonRisk2022 and @liuCommonRisk2020 construct a similar three-factor model for cryptocurrency returns using market, size, and momentum factors. Using weekly data, they show that this model captures a large share of cryptocurrency returns and, in particular, reveals strong anomaly effects in the momentum and size factors. However, @jungCommonFactors2024 show that the three-factor model of @liuCommonRisk2022 explains only about one-third of cryptocurrency return variation. They attribute the remaining variation to a common component outside the three-factor model, closely linked to the value of fiat money, highlighting the role of global macroeconomic variables in cryptocurrency pricing. Further work by @liuRisksReturns2021 shows that cryptocurrency returns are also linked to network factors, which capture user adoption. They also find strong momentum effects and show that investor attention can predict future returns. Building on these findings, @congValuePremium2022 show that value and network adoption provide strong risk premia across more than 4,000 cryptocurrencies. They propose a five-factor “C-5” model --market, size, momentum, value, and network--that performs better than earlier models in- and out-of-sample, and also report market segmentation across different categories of cryptocurrencies.

Studies adopting a latent-factor structure include @bouriForecastingReturns2022 and @bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021. @bouriForecastingReturns2022 apply a regime-switching factor model, where the comovement of cryptocurrency returns depends on market states. They show that accounting for these state-dependent comovements improves the forecasting performance of major cryptocurrencies compared to standard PCA and a random-walk model. In contrast, @bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021 apply the IPCA model to the cryptocurrency market, constructing 32 characteristics to instrument the dynamic factor loadings. They show that this time-varying latent-factor framework measures the variation in realized returns more accurately than conventional observable-factor models or standard PCA, both at the daily and weekly frequency. They also find that characteristics related to speculative demand and liquidity are the most significant in capturing the systematic mispricing of returns.


## Data concerns

One of the main challenges in this thesis was obtaining a large panel of cryptocurrency data. I extracted market data from the free [CoinCodex](https://coincodex.com/) API, which provides access to the full historical data of the cryptocurrencies listed on its platform. In contrast, most crypto market data providers --also called coin-ranking sites, such as CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, CryptoCompare (CoinDesk)-- offer limited access to historical data (usually one year) or none at all without a paid subscription. Some exchange platforms, such as Bybit, Binance, Coinbase, and Cex, allow users to extract market data for free through their public APIs. However, the number of cryptocurrencies (and thus, the cross-section) available from these sources was relatively small compared with CoinCoidex, and the time span was shorter ^[For example, Bitcoin data started from late 2013 in CoinCodex, compared to November, 2022 in Bybit, January, 2019, in Binance, and June, 2021, in Coinbase. The available cryptocurrencies paired with Tether USD (USD) were 763 in Bybit, 623 in Binance, and 116 (USD) in Coinbase.]. 

The choice of which data source is appropriate for scientific research is subject to debate. For example, @alexanderCriticalInvestigation2020 examine different cryptocurrency data providers and find inconsistencies in regression estimates, suggesting that the source of cryptocurrency data can influence empirical results.  Moreover, they document distorted coin prices on coin-ranking sites, caused by inflated or artificial trading volumes^[Coin-ranking sites rank coins and exchanges by trading volume and market capitalization. As highlighted by @alexanderCriticalInvestigation2020, the prices quoted on some of these sites are calculated by aggregating the prices from hundreds of exchanges using a volume-weighted average. Because many exchanges artificially inflate their volume to boost their position in the rankings, the resulting aggregated prices are influenced by fake volumes and therefore inconsistent with traded prices.], emphasizing the importance of using traded data from crypto exchanges. By contrast, @vidal-tomasWhichCryptocurrency2022 argue that coin-ranking sites use the same underlying process as crypto exchanges and other platforms to compute a cryptocurrency price, and they report no significant differences in empirical results when using alternative data sources. To address these concerns, I apply a series of pre-processing filters, described in [Section -@sec-data], to mitigate the impact of potential inaccuracies in my dataset. 

The remainder of the thesis is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes the IPCA model, the estimation strategy and the performance measures applied in the analysis. Section 3 describes the data extraction and the sample construction process. Section 4 presents the empirical findings, and Section 5 concludes.
