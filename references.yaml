    We examine the role of systematic mispricing and risk compensation for the
    dynamic of cryptocurrency returns. To this end, we leverage the flexibility
    of instrumented principal component analysis whereby time-varying
    coefficients are a function of cryptocurrency characteristics. We show that
    market, size, and past performance are crucial to explaining factor
    exposures, yet mispricing is pervasive and linked to the speculative nature
    of cryptocurrencies. Motivated by this evidence, we show that a dynamic
    latent factor framework better explains the variation of cryptocurrency
    returns than previously proposed observable factor models. Our results also
    indicate an increasing correlation between cryptocurrency and equity
    markets.

  abstract: >-
    We find that three factors—cryptocurrency market, size, and momentum—capture
    the cross-sectional expected cryptocurrency returns. We consider a
    comprehensive list of price- and market-related return predictors in the
    stock market and construct their cryptocurrency counterparts. Ten
    cryptocurrency characteristics form successful long-short strategies that
    generate sizable and statistically significant excess returns, and we show
    that all of these strategies are accounted for by the cryptocurrency
    three-factor model. Lastly, we examine potential underlying mechanisms of
    the cryptocurrency size and momentum effects.

  abstract: >-
    We investigate interaction effects in cryptocurrency markets by constructing
    and evaluating double-sorted portfolios based on 40 different
    characteristics. Using a dataset of over 500 major coins and tokens from
    2017 to 2023, we identify numerous significant interactions. The most
    pronounced effects arise from the interplay of liquidity, risk, and past
    return measures. An out-of-sample long-short strategy that selects the top
    and bottom interactions achieves a Sharpe ratio exceeding 1. However,
    network graph analysis and additional tests reveal that low liquidity, which
    raises transaction costs, can dampen trading activity and contribute to the
    persistence of these anomalies.

    We document significant “time series momentum” in equity index, currency,
    commodity, and bond futures for each of the 58 liquid instruments we
    consider. We find persistence in returns for one to 12 months that partially
    reverses over longer horizons, consistent with sentiment theories of initial
    under-reaction and delayed over-reaction. A diversified portfolio of time
    series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial
    abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and
    performs best during extreme markets. Examining the trading activities of
    speculators and hedgers, we find that speculators profit from time series
    momentum at the expense of hedgers.
