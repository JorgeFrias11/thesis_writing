  abstract: >-
    This paper shows that over time, expected market illiquidity positively
    affects ex ante stock excess return, suggesting that expected stock excess
    return partly represents an illiquidity premium. This complements the
    cross-sectional positive return–illiquidity relationship. Also, stock
    returns are negatively related over time to contemporaneous unexpected
    illiquidity. The illiquidity measure here is the average across stocks of
    the daily ratio of absolute stock return to dollar volume, which is easily
    obtained from daily stock data for long time series in most stock markets.
    Illiquidity affects more strongly small firm stocks, thus explaining time
    series variations in their premiums over time.

  abstract: >-
    We examine the pricing of aggregate volatility risk in the cross-section of
    stock returns. Consistent with theory, we find that stocks with high
    sensitivities to innovations in aggregate volatility have low average
    returns. Stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility relative to the Fama and
    French (1993, Journal of Financial Economics 25, 2349) model have abysmally
    low average returns. This phenomenon cannot be explained by exposure to
    aggregate volatility risk. Size, book-to-market, momentum, and liquidity
    effects cannot account for either the low average returns earned by stocks
    with high exposure to systematic volatility risk or for the low average
    returns of stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility.

    The technologies underlying money and payment systems are evolving rapidly.
    Both the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and rapid advances
    in traditional centralised systems are moving the technological horizon of
    money and payments. These trends are embodied in private “stablecoins”:
    cryptocurrencies with values tied to fiat currencies or other assets.
    Stablecoins – in particular potential “global stablecoins” such as
    Facebook’s Libra proposal – pose a range of challenges from the standpoint
    of financial authorities around the world. At the same time, regulatory
    responses to global stablecoins should take into account the potential of
    other stablecoin uses, such as embedding a robust monetary instrument into
    digital environments, especially in the context of decentralised systems.
    Looking forward, in such cases, one possible option from a regulatory
    standpoint is to embed supervisory requirements into stablecoin systems
    themselves, allowing for “embedded supervision”. Yet it is an open question
    whether central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and other initiatives could
    in fact provide more effective solutions to fulfill the functions that
    stablecoins are meant to address.

    Cryptocurrencies surged in popularity as an alternative medium of payment
    and security among both users and investors. However, the recent collapse of
    Bitcoin, Ether, and other traditional cryptocurrencies has raised concern
    about their capacity to function as a good store of value, investment, or
    hedge. Stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency that backed by physical or
    financial assets, have emerged as a potential solution. However, the latest
    failures of some algorithmic stablecoins and depegging of fiat-backed
    stablecoins have demonstrated that not all stablecoins can guarantee their
    stability. This study examines precious metal–backed stablecoins as a more
    stable alternative and attempts to identify the most suitable metal. We
    employed MGARCH-DCC, wavelet coherence, and simulation-based optimization
    techniques to explore the optimal precious metal for this purpose. Our
    findings indicate that a combination of gold and silver at a ratio of 88:12
    is optimal. We offer critical policy implications and recommendations for
    various stakeholders.

    Motivated by the cross-sectional and temporal fluctuations in their trading
    activity, digital assets provide a fruitful environment to investigate the
    impact of trading activity on expected returns. Portfolio-level analyses and
    cryptocurrency-level cross- sectional regressions demonstrate a negative and
    significant relation between expected returns and variability of dollar
    trading volume and turnover. This effect is robust to controls for beta,
    size, momentum, network premium, lottery demand, liquidity, idiosyncratic,
    volatility, and downside risks. The effect of trading activity variation is
    more pronounced among cryptocurrencies that are costlier to arbitrage. A
    zero-cost strategy exploiting this predictability survives transaction
    costs, various size and liquidity screens.

    The design of Bitcoin is closely related to gold which has led to the idea
    that Bitcoin has gold-like features such as being a store of value and a
    safe haven. However, given Bitcoin’s extreme volatility investors may rather
    need a safe haven against Bitcoin. We hypothesize that stablecoins provide
    such a safe haven and analyze high-frequency price changes of the largest
    stablecoins. We find that they act as safe havens, and Tether showing the
    strongest effect. The results demonstrate that Bitcoin investors seek out
    stablecoins when Bitcoin experiences extreme negative prices changes. Since
    stablecoins react to such price changes they are not stable at all times.

    We examine the role of systematic mispricing and risk compensation for the
    dynamic of cryptocurrency returns. To this end, we leverage the flexibility
    of instrumented principal component analysis whereby time-varying
    coefficients are a function of cryptocurrency characteristics. We show that
    market, size, and past performance are crucial to explaining factor
    exposures, yet mispricing is pervasive and linked to the speculative nature
    of cryptocurrencies. Motivated by this evidence, we show that a dynamic
    latent factor framework better explains the variation of cryptocurrency
    returns than previously proposed observable factor models. Our results also
    indicate an increasing correlation between cryptocurrency and equity
    markets.

  abstract: >-
    We examine the implications of arbitrage in a market with many assets. The
    absence of arbitrage opportunities implies that the linear functionals that
    give the mean and cost of a portfolio are continuous; hence there exist
    unique portfolios that represent these functionals. These portfolios span
    the mean-variance efficient set. We resolve the question of when a market
    with many assets permits so much diversification that risk-free investment
    opportunities are available. Ross [12, 14] showed that if there is a factor
    structure, then the mean returns are approximately linear functions of
    factor loadings. We define an approximate factor structure and show that
    this weaker restriction is sufficient for Ross' result. If the covariance
    matrix of the asset returns has only K unbounded eigenvalues, then there is
    an approximate factor structure and it is unique. The corresponding K
    eigenvectors converge and play the role of factor loadings. Hence only a
    principal component analysis is needed in empirical work.

    Are there risk factors that are pervasive across major classes of corporate
    securities: stocks, bonds, and options? We employ a novel econometric
    procedure that relies on asset characteristics to estimate a conditional
    latent factor model. A common risk factor structure prominently emerges
    across asset classes. Several common factors explain a substantial amount of
    time-series variation of individual asset returns across all three asset
    classes, and have sizable Sharpe ratios. Several of our factors are highly
    correlated with some of asset-class-specific factors as well as
    macroeconomic and financial variables. While a small set of common factors
    does not fully capture the cross-section of average returns, imposing the
    factor structure is useful in practice, especially in out-of-sample
    analysis. A mean-variance efficient portfolio that utilizes asset
    characteristics achieves a high Sharpe ratio as different asset classes
    hedge each other's exposures to the common factors.

    Cryptocurrency trading is subject to strict government-imposed restrictions
    in China since September 2017, when trading platforms were shut down. Using
    a VAR-GARCH-BEKK model, we investigate the effectiveness of this trading ban
    by examining its consequences on the relationship between Chinese investors’
    attention and Bitcoin. Our results demonstrate that Chinese investors played
    a dominant role in the Bitcoin price formation before the ban, and that
    their influence has not significantly decreased after the shutdown of
    Chinese trading platforms. Aiming to explain our findings, we provide strong
    evidence that the crackdown on Bitcoin trading has not been effective as
    Chinese investors continue to purchase Bitcoin using the stablecoin Tether
    instead of Chinese yuan.

    We provide data and code that successfully reproduces nearly all
    cross-sectional stock return predictors.  Our 319 characteristics draw from
    previous meta-studies, but we differ by comparing our t-stats to the
    original papers' results.  For the 161 characteristics that were clearly
    significant in the original papers, 98% of our long-short portfolios find
    t-stats above 1.96.   For the 44 characteristics that had mixed evidence,
    our reproductions find t-stats of 2 on average. A regression of reproduced
    t-stats on original long-short t-stats finds a slope of 0.88 and an R^2 of
    82%.  Mean returns are monotonic in predictive signals at the characteristic
    level.  The remaining 114 characteristics were  insignificant in the
    original papers or are modifications of the originals created by Hou, Xue,
    and Zhang (2020).  These remaining characteristics are almost always
    significant if the original characteristic was also significant.

  abstract: "We introduce a simple and tractable methodology for estimating semiparametric conditional latent factor models. Our approach disentangles the roles of characteristics in capturing factor betas of asset returns from ``alpha.''\_ We construct factors by extracting principal components from Fama-MacBeth managed portfolios. Applying this methodology to the cross-section of U.S. individual stock returns, we find compelling evidence of substantial nonzero pricing errors, even though our factors demonstrate superior performance in standard asset pricing tests. Unexplained ``arbitrage'' portfolios earn high Sharpe ratios, which decline over time. Combining factors with these orthogonal portfolios produces out-of-sample Sharpe ratios exceeding 4."

    This paper develops a theory and econometric method of portfolio performance

    Theory. We show that the Jensen coefficient and the appraisal ratio of
    Treynor and Black are theoretically compatible with the Arbitrage Pricing
    Theory. We construct estimators for the two performance measures using a new
    principal components technique, and describe their asymptotic distributions.
    The estimators are computationally feasible using a large number of
    securities. We also suggest a new approach to testing for the correct number
    of factors.

    This paper provides an alternative test of Amihud and Mendelson's (1986,
    Journal of Financial Economics, 8, 31–35) model using the turnover rate
    (number of shares traded as a fraction of the number of shares outstanding)
    as a proxy for liquidity. The evidence suggests that liquidity plays a
    significant role in explaining the cross-sectional variation in stock
    returns. This effect persists after controlling for the well known
    determinants of stock returns like the firm-size, book-to-market ratio and
    the firm beta. Unlike Eleswarapu and Reinganum (1993, Journal of Financial
    Economics, 34, 373–386), this paper finds that the liquidity effect is not
    restricted to the month of January alone and is prevalent throughout the
    year. The evidence supports Amihud and Mendelson's (1986) notion of
    liquidity premium and establishes its role in the overall cross section of
    stock returns.

  abstract: >-
    This paper identifies five common risk factors in the returns on stocks and
    bonds. There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and
    factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two
    bond-market factors, related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns
    have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked
    to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except
    for low-grade corporates, the bond-market factors capture the common
    variation in bond returns. Most important, the five factors seem to explain
    average returns on stocks and bonds.

  abstract: >-
    A five-factor model directed at capturing the size, value, profitability,
    and investment patterns in average stock returns performs better than the
    three-factor model of Fama and French (FF, 1993). The five-factor model׳s
    main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small
    stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite
    low profitability. The model׳s performance is not sensitive to the way its
    factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment
    factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for
    describing average returns in the sample we examine.

    We propose a model selection method to systematically evaluate the
    contribution to asset pricing of any new factor, above and beyond what a
    high-dimensional set of existing factors explains. Our methodology accounts
    for model selection mistakes that produce a bias due to omitted variables,
    unlike standard approaches that assume perfect variable selection. We apply
    our procedure to a set of factors recently discovered in the literature.
    While most of these new factors are shown to be redundant relative to the
    existing factors, a few have statistically significant explanatory power
    beyond the hundreds of factors proposed in the past.

  abstract: >-
    We present the first evidence of investor-trading-based disagreement's
    influence on cross-sectional cryptocurrency daily returns. We interpret
    abnormal trading volume as investor disagreement and find evidence in
    support of Miller's disagreement model: when short-sale constraints are
    binding, high abnormal volume (high disagreement) assets experience lower
    future returns. Further supporting Miller, these same conditions associate
    with higher contemporaneous order imbalance, and ex post decreases in both
    buying and selling activities, with the former exceeding the latter in
    magnitude. By contrast, the effect of high disagreement disappears after a
    coin's margin trading is activated. We conclude that price-optimism models
    explain the disagreement-returns relationship when opinion divergence is
    likely the dominant determinant of returns.

    Numerous proxies for divergence of investors' opinions have been suggested
    in the empirical accounting and finance literatures. I offer a new proxy
    constructed from proprietary limit order and market order data. This allows
    me to capture additional information on investors' private valuations.
    Proxies from the extant literature, based on publicly available data, do not
    contain such information. Given my new measure, I ask which of the extant
    proxies correlates best with it. In my regression analysis, unexplained
    volume is the best proxy for opinion divergence. Conditioning on various
    firm-specific and order-specific characteristics generally does not change
    this conclusion. The main exception is the sample of firms without IBES
    forecast dispersion data, for which bid-ask spread is the best proxy for
    opinion divergence. Factor analysis also suggests that unexplained volume is
    the preferred proxy for opinion divergence.

  abstract: >-
    When coupled with a stock's current price, a readily available piece of
    information—the 52-week high price–explains a large portion of the profits
    from momentum investing. Nearness to the 52-week high dominates and improves
    upon the forecasting power of past returns (both individual and industry
    returns) for future returns. Future returns forecast using the 52-week high
    do not reverse in the long run. These results indicate that short-term
    momentum and long-term reversals are largely separate phenomena, which
    presents a challenge to current theory that models these aspects of security
    returns as integrated components of the market's response to news.

    This paper analyzes the stability of stablecoins and proposes a framework to
    test for absolute and relative stability of stablecoins. Based on
    high-frequency data, we find strong evidence of excess price variations.
    While Bitcoin is a likely source of this excess volatility because
    stablecoin returns, volatility and volumes are highly correlated with
    corresponding Bitcoin time-series, we also demonstrate through a
    quasi-natural experiment that stablecoins increase the trading volume of
    Bitcoin. The findings suggest stablecoins play a key role in cryptocurrency
    markets.

  abstract: >-
    We parsimoniously characterize the severity of market frictions affecting a
    stock using the delay with which its price responds to information. The most
    delayed firms command a large return premium not explained by size,
    liquidity, or microstructure effects. Moreover, delay captures part of the
    size effect, idiosyncratic risk is priced only among the most delayed firms,
    and earnings drift is monotonically increasing in delay. Frictions
    associated with investor recognition appear most responsible for the delay
    effect. The very small segment of delayed firms, comprising only 0.02% of
    the market, generates substantial variation in average returns, highlighting
    the importance of frictions.

    We propose a new modeling approach for the cross section of returns. Our
    method, Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA), allows for latent
    factors and time-varying loadings by introducing observable characteristics
    that instrument for the unobservable dynamic loadings. If the
    characteristics/expected return relationship is driven by compensation for
    exposure to latent risk factors, IPCA will identify the corresponding latent
    factors. If no such factors exist, IPCA infers that the characteristic
    effect is compensation without risk and allocates it to an “anomaly”
    intercept. Studying returns and characteristics at the stock-level, we find
    that five IPCA factors explain the cross section of average returns
    significantly more accurately than existing factor models and produce
    characteristic-associated anomaly intercepts that are small and
    statistically insignificant. Furthermore, among a large collection of
    characteristics explored in the literature, only ten are statistically
    significant at the 1% level in the IPCA specification and are responsible
    for nearly 100% of the model’s accuracy.

    We propose a new approach of latent factor analysis that, in addition to the
    main panel of interest, introduces other relevant data that serve as
    instruments for dynamic factor loadings.The method, called IPCA, provides a
    parsimonious means of incorporating vast conditioning information into
    factor model estimates. This improves the efficiency of estimates for the
    latent factors and their loadings, and helps to ascertain the economic
    relationships among factors and individuals via the observable instruments.
    The estimation is fast to calculate and accommodates unbalanced panels. We
    show consistency and asymptotic normality under general panel data
    generating processes. We demonstrate the advantages of IPCA in simulated
    data and in applications to equity asset pricing and international
    macroeconomics.

  abstract: >-
    Recent studies suggest that the conditional CAPM holds, period by period,
    and that time-variation in risk and expected returns can explain why the
    unconditional CAPM fails. In contrast, we argue that variation in betas and
    the equity premium would have to be implausibly large to explain important
    asset-pricing anomalies like momentum and the value premium. We also provide
    a simple new test of the conditional CAPM using direct estimates of
    conditional alphas and betas from short-window regressions, avoiding the
    need to specify conditioning information. The tests show that the
    conditional CAPM performs nearly as poorly as the unconditional CAPM,
    consistent with our analytical results.

    We find that three factors—cryptocurrency market, size, and momentum—capture
    the cross-sectional expected cryptocurrency returns. We consider a
    comprehensive list of price- and market-related return predictors in the
    stock market and construct their cryptocurrency counterparts. Ten
    cryptocurrency characteristics form successful long-short strategies that
    generate sizable and statistically significant excess returns, and we show
    that all of these strategies are accounted for by the cryptocurrency
    three-factor model. Lastly, we examine potential underlying mechanisms of
    the cryptocurrency size and momentum effects.

  abstract: >-
    We examine the dynamic relation between return and volume of individual
    stocks. Using a simple model in which investors trade to share risk or
    speculate on private information, we show that returns generated by
    risk-sharing trades tend to reverse themselves, while returns generated by
    speculative trades tend to continue themselves. We test this theoretical
    prediction by analyzing the relation between daily volume and first-order
    return autocorrelation for individual stocks listed on the NYSE and AMEX. We
    find that the cross-sectional variation in the relation between volume and
    return autocorrelation is related to the extent of informed trading in a
    manner consistent with the theoretical prediction.

    We investigate interaction effects in cryptocurrency markets by constructing
    and evaluating double-sorted portfolios based on 40 different
    characteristics. Using a dataset of over 500 major coins and tokens from
    2017 to 2023, we identify numerous significant interactions. The most
    pronounced effects arise from the interplay of liquidity, risk, and past
    return measures. An out-of-sample long-short strategy that selects the top
    and bottom interactions achieves a Sharpe ratio exceeding 1. However,
    network graph analysis and additional tests reveal that low liquidity, which
    raises transaction costs, can dampen trading activity and contribute to the
    persistence of these anomalies.

    We document significant “time series momentum” in equity index, currency,
    commodity, and bond futures for each of the 58 liquid instruments we
    consider. We find persistence in returns for one to 12 months that partially
    reverses over longer horizons, consistent with sentiment theories of initial
    under-reaction and delayed over-reaction. A diversified portfolio of time
    series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial
    abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and
    performs best during extreme markets. Examining the trading activities of
    speculators and hedgers, we find that speculators profit from time series
    momentum at the expense of hedgers.

  abstract: >-
    Inspired by Alexander and Dakos (2020), we shed more light on the adequacy
    of data in the cryptocurrency literature by analysing the scaling properties
    and underlying processes of the main cryptocurrency databases
    (Coinmarketcap, Coingecko, BraveNewCoin and Cryptocompare) and exchange
    platforms (Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Cexio and Exmo). Our results show
    that coin-ranking sites, such as Coinmarketcap, Coingecko and BraveNewCoin
    (i) include most of the cryptocurrency trading activity and (ii) are
    essentially characterised by the same underlying processes as the main
    exchange platforms (Coinbase and Bitstamp) and alternative coin-ranking
    sites (Cryptocompare), regardless of the possible issues arising from the
    aggregation of different exchanges to compute a unique cryptocurrency price.
    Therefore, we state that these databases are appropriate to conduct
    research. At any rate, we observe that all the databases analysed in this
    paper show the same underlying process for most liquid cryptocurrencies;
    consequently, scholars could use any of them for their studies, as long as
    they consider the different trading activity included by each database. This
    result is supported by an empirical analysis focused on weak-form market
    efficiency, since we report the same degree of efficiency regardless of the
    database and exchange platform. Nevertheless, we recognise the need for
    further research, given the gap in the literature and the black-box method
    used by coin-ranking sites to compute a unique cryptocurrency price.

    We study the diversifier, hedge, and safe haven properties of stablecoins
    against traditional cryptocurrencies. Using the DCC-GARCH model and dummy
    variable regression, we examine the risk-dispersion abilities of USD-pegged
    and gold-pegged stablecoins against traditional cryptocurrencies, and also
    compare their risk-dispersion abilities with their underlying assets. The
    empirical results show that (i) stablecoins can serve as safe havens in
    specific situations, although most act merely as an effective diversifier in
    normal market conditions; (ii) gold-pegged stablecoins perform worse as safe
    havens than USD-pegged ones, but both of them perform better than their
    corresponding underlying assets, and (iii) the safe haven property of
    stablecoins changes across market conditions. The above results are robust
    when using time-varying copula models. We further evaluate the risk
    management applications of stablecoins by analyzing mixed
    cryptocurrency-stablecoin portfolios, finding evidence of USD-pegged
    stablecoins performing better than gold-pegged stablecoins in extreme risk
    reductions. Our work provides important insights into diversification for
    cryptocurrency investors.

    This study employs event study methodology to investigate the impact of
    various types of events on cryptocurrency market returns and volatility. The
    research focuses on six major cryptocurrencies—ETH, BTC, BNB, XRP, DOGE, and
    TRX—over the period from December 31, 2017, to October 30, 2023. Six types
    of events are analyzed: cybersecurity events, block reward adjustment
    events, political conflict events, public health emergency events,
    cryptocurrency recognition and support events, and social media sentiment
    events. The findings reveal that cybersecurity and block reward adjustment
    events have minimal and short-lived impacts on market returns. Political
    conflict events cause significant short-term return volatility depending on
    market expectations. Public health emergency events, such as the COVID-19
    pandemic, have significant and lasting negative impacts on market returns.
    Cryptocurrency recognition and support events have significant and sustained
    positive impacts on market returns. Social media sentiment events have
    significant but short-lived impacts on market returns. The robustness of the
    results was validated through the analysis of abnormal returns during the
    event period. This study provides valuable insights for investors and
    policymakers in managing market volatility.
