    We document significant “time series momentum” in equity index, currency,
    commodity, and bond futures for each of the 58 liquid instruments we
    consider. We find persistence in returns for one to 12 months that partially
    reverses over longer horizons, consistent with sentiment theories of initial
    under-reaction and delayed over-reaction. A diversified portfolio of time
    series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial
    abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and
    performs best during extreme markets. Examining the trading activities of
    speculators and hedgers, we find that speculators profit from time series
    momentum at the expense of hedgers.
