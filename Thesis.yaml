    We examine the role of systematic mispricing and risk compensation for the
    dynamic of cryptocurrency returns. To this end, we leverage the flexibility
    of instrumented principal component analysis whereby time-varying
    coefficients are a function of cryptocurrency characteristics. We show that
    market, size, and past performance are crucial to explaining factor
    exposures, yet mispricing is pervasive and linked to the speculative nature
    of cryptocurrencies. Motivated by this evidence, we show that a dynamic
    latent factor framework better explains the variation of cryptocurrency
    returns than previously proposed observable factor models. Our results also
    indicate an increasing correlation between cryptocurrency and equity
    markets.

  abstract: >-
    We examine the implications of arbitrage in a market with many assets. The
    absence of arbitrage opportunities implies that the linear functionals that
    give the mean and cost of a portfolio are continuous; hence there exist
    unique portfolios that represent these functionals. These portfolios span
    the mean-variance efficient set. We resolve the question of when a market
    with many assets permits so much diversification that risk-free investment
    opportunities are available. Ross [12, 14] showed that if there is a factor
    structure, then the mean returns are approximately linear functions of
    factor loadings. We define an approximate factor structure and show that
    this weaker restriction is sufficient for Ross' result. If the covariance
    matrix of the asset returns has only K unbounded eigenvalues, then there is
    an approximate factor structure and it is unique. The corresponding K
    eigenvectors converge and play the role of factor loadings. Hence only a
    principal component analysis is needed in empirical work.

    Are there risk factors that are pervasive across major classes of corporate
    securities: stocks, bonds, and options? We employ a novel econometric
    procedure that relies on asset characteristics to estimate a conditional
    latent factor model. A common risk factor structure prominently emerges
    across asset classes. Several common factors explain a substantial amount of
    time-series variation of individual asset returns across all three asset
    classes, and have sizable Sharpe ratios. Several of our factors are highly
    correlated with some of asset-class-specific factors as well as
    macroeconomic and financial variables. While a small set of common factors
    does not fully capture the cross-section of average returns, imposing the
    factor structure is useful in practice, especially in out-of-sample
    analysis. A mean-variance efficient portfolio that utilizes asset
    characteristics achieves a high Sharpe ratio as different asset classes
    hedge each other's exposures to the common factors.

    We provide data and code that successfully reproduces nearly all
    cross-sectional stock return predictors.  Our 319 characteristics draw from
    previous meta-studies, but we differ by comparing our t-stats to the
    original papers' results.  For the 161 characteristics that were clearly
    significant in the original papers, 98% of our long-short portfolios find
    t-stats above 1.96.   For the 44 characteristics that had mixed evidence,
    our reproductions find t-stats of 2 on average. A regression of reproduced
    t-stats on original long-short t-stats finds a slope of 0.88 and an R^2 of
    82%.  Mean returns are monotonic in predictive signals at the characteristic
    level.  The remaining 114 characteristics were  insignificant in the
    original papers or are modifications of the originals created by Hou, Xue,
    and Zhang (2020).  These remaining characteristics are almost always
    significant if the original characteristic was also significant.

  abstract: "We introduce a simple and tractable methodology for estimating semiparametric conditional latent factor models. Our approach disentangles the roles of characteristics in capturing factor betas of asset returns from ``alpha.''\_ We construct factors by extracting principal components from Fama-MacBeth managed portfolios. Applying this methodology to the cross-section of U.S. individual stock returns, we find compelling evidence of substantial nonzero pricing errors, even though our factors demonstrate superior performance in standard asset pricing tests. Unexplained ``arbitrage'' portfolios earn high Sharpe ratios, which decline over time. Combining factors with these orthogonal portfolios produces out-of-sample Sharpe ratios exceeding 4."

    This paper develops a theory and econometric method of portfolio performance
    measurement using a competitive equilibrium version of the Arbitrage Pricing
    Theory. We show that the Jensen coefficient and the appraisal ratio of
    Treynor and Black are theoretically compatible with the Arbitrage Pricing
    Theory. We construct estimators for the two performance measures using a new
    principal components technique, and describe their asymptotic distributions.
    The estimators are computationally feasible using a large number of
    securities. We also suggest a new approach to testing for the correct number
    of factors.

    This paper identifies five common risk factors in the returns on stocks and
    bonds. There are three stock-market factors: an overall market factor and
    factors related to firm size and book-to-market equity. There are two
    bond-market factors, related to maturity and default risks. Stock returns
    have shared variation due to the stock-market factors, and they are linked
    to bond returns through shared variation in the bond-market factors. Except
    for low-grade corporates, the bond-market factors capture the common
    variation in bond returns. Most important, the five factors seem to explain
    average returns on stocks and bonds.

  abstract: >-
    A five-factor model directed at capturing the size, value, profitability,
    and investment patterns in average stock returns performs better than the
    three-factor model of Fama and French (FF, 1993). The five-factor model׳s
    main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small
    stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite
    low profitability. The model׳s performance is not sensitive to the way its
    factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment
    factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for
    describing average returns in the sample we examine.

  abstract: >-
    We propose a new modeling approach for the cross section of returns. Our
    method, Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA), allows for latent
    factors and time-varying loadings by introducing observable characteristics
    that instrument for the unobservable dynamic loadings. If the
    characteristics/expected return relationship is driven by compensation for
    exposure to latent risk factors, IPCA will identify the corresponding latent
    factors. If no such factors exist, IPCA infers that the characteristic
    effect is compensation without risk and allocates it to an “anomaly”
    intercept. Studying returns and characteristics at the stock-level, we find
    that five IPCA factors explain the cross section of average returns
    significantly more accurately than existing factor models and produce
    characteristic-associated anomaly intercepts that are small and
    statistically insignificant. Furthermore, among a large collection of
    characteristics explored in the literature, only ten are statistically
    significant at the 1% level in the IPCA specification and are responsible
    for nearly 100% of the model’s accuracy.

    We find that three factors—cryptocurrency market, size, and momentum—capture
    the cross-sectional expected cryptocurrency returns. We consider a
    comprehensive list of price- and market-related return predictors in the
    stock market and construct their cryptocurrency counterparts. Ten
    cryptocurrency characteristics form successful long-short strategies that
    generate sizable and statistically significant excess returns, and we show
    that all of these strategies are accounted for by the cryptocurrency
    three-factor model. Lastly, we examine potential underlying mechanisms of
    the cryptocurrency size and momentum effects.

    We investigate interaction effects in cryptocurrency markets by constructing
    and evaluating double-sorted portfolios based on 40 different
    characteristics. Using a dataset of over 500 major coins and tokens from
    2017 to 2023, we identify numerous significant interactions. The most
    pronounced effects arise from the interplay of liquidity, risk, and past
    return measures. An out-of-sample long-short strategy that selects the top
    and bottom interactions achieves a Sharpe ratio exceeding 1. However,
    network graph analysis and additional tests reveal that low liquidity, which
    raises transaction costs, can dampen trading activity and contribute to the
    persistence of these anomalies.

    We document significant “time series momentum” in equity index, currency,
    commodity, and bond futures for each of the 58 liquid instruments we
    consider. We find persistence in returns for one to 12 months that partially
    reverses over longer horizons, consistent with sentiment theories of initial
    under-reaction and delayed over-reaction. A diversified portfolio of time
    series momentum strategies across all asset classes delivers substantial
    abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and
    performs best during extreme markets. Examining the trading activities of
    speculators and hedgers, we find that speculators profit from time series
    momentum at the expense of hedgers.
