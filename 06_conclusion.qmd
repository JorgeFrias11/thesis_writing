# Conclusion

The main research question in this thesis is whether cryptocurrency returns can be explained and predicted by a set of systematic risk factors. The question is examined from both a static and a dynamic perspective, where factor loadings are either fixed or allowed to vary over time. The aim is to construct, within a high-dimensional framework, a small set of latent factors that could potentially outperform classical factor models, which are typically based on sorted portfolio strategies.

The IPCA approach of @kellyCharacteristicsAre2019 has been widely used to study the cross-section of returns across different asset classes. By modelling factor loadings as linear functions of asset-specific characteristics, IPCA allows a large set of characteristics to serve as instruments for the factor loadings, enabling them to evolve dynamically over time and to accommodate unbalanced panels of data. This feature is particularly important in the context of cryptocurrencies, where the sample include coins that are introduced or disappear at different points in time. Standard PCA or dynamic PCA would not have been feasible without substantially reducing the cross-section or the sample period.

My results show that a small number of latent factors, extracted with IPCA, capture a meaningful share of the variation in cryptocurrency returns when compared to a traditional static model. These factors are mainly linked to short-term trading activity, volatility, and return distribution, while two are associated with a mispricing factor (CAPM alpha) and a market factor (CAPM beta). Allowing for anomaly intercepts improves the in-sample fit but adds no predictive power, as confirmed by the asset-pricing tests: characteristics explain realized returns only through their exposure to systematic risk. 

The IPCA also performs strongly in out-of-sample forecasts. Both dynamic models, pure latent or including observable factors, provide a greater explanatory and predictive power than static models at the individual cryptocurrency level. Including observable factors to the latent IPCA specification slightly improves the ability to improve return variation, but does not enhance predictive performance in terms of risk compensation. 

Consistent with @bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021, I find that characteristics related to past returns and return distribution are the most significant for explaining the variation in factor exposures, with most of this characteristics being statistically significant at the 1% level. Finally, in line with @kellyCharacteristicsAre2019, my results show that fitting the model with only a small subset of significant characteristics (corresponding to 25% of the total) produces similar results compared to those of the full specification. This indicates that IPCA effectively filters out irrelevant information and retains the key characteristics that capture systematic risk exposures, thereby explaining the cross-section of returns.
