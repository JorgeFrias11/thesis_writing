\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by Satoshi
Nakamoto, who presented it as a peer-to-peer electronic coin with
secured and verified transactions through an encrypted proof-of-work
mechanism (\citeproc{ref-nakamoto2008bitcoin}{Nakamoto, 2008}). As
originally proposed, Bitcoin was designed as an alternative,
decentralized cash system offering low-cost and near-real-time
transactions, while avoiding currency controls imposed by national
governments or financial institutions\footnote{Contrary to the common
  belief, Bitcoin is not anonymous. All Bitcoin transactions are
  publicly visible in the network and only the identity of the user
  behind a Bitcoin address is unknown, until their idendity is revealed
  through a pruchase or another action. See Meiklejohn et al.
  (\citeproc{ref-meiklejohnFistfulBitcoins2013}{2013}) and
  https://bitcoin.org/en/you-need-to-know.}
(\citeproc{ref-dwyerEconomicsBitcoin2015}{Dwyer, 2015}). These features
quickly attracted widespread public attention. However, due to its high
volatility, researchers have questioned its role as a purely digital
currency and instead classified it as an investment or speculative asset
(\citeproc{ref-baurBitcoinMedium2018}{Baur et al., 2018};
\citeproc{ref-baurVolatilityBitcoin2021}{Baur \& Dimpfl, 2021};
\citeproc{ref-glaserBitcoinAsset2014}{Glaser et al., 2014}).

Since then, the cryptocurrency market has expanded rapidly, giving rise
to thousands of new coins. In the second quarter of 2025, the total
cryptocurrency market capitalization amounted to nearly 3.5 trillion
USD, according to data from CoinGecko
(\citeproc{ref-coingecko2025Q2}{n.d.}). Despite this rapid growth,
perceptions of cryptocurrencies remain divided. Some view them as
investments tied to the underlying technologies, such as blockchain and
smart contracts, or simply as a form of speculation
(\citeproc{ref-baekBitcoinsInvestment2015}{Baek \& Elbeck, 2015};
\citeproc{ref-vasudevaCryptocurrencyInvestment2023}{Vasudeva, 2023}).
Others, however, see them as bubbles, fraud schemes, or scams, often
driven by internet and social media marketing---for example, rug pulls
involving so-called ``memecoins,'' or, more recently, the LIBRA
cryptocurrency scandal in February 2025, when the coin was promoted by
Argentinian president Javier Milei, soared in value, and collapsed only
a few hours later (\citeproc{ref-kalachevaDetectingRug2025}{Kalacheva et
al., 2025}; \citeproc{ref-nicasMileiux24Melania2025}{Nicas et al.,
2025}; \citeproc{ref-yaffe-bellanyDigitalCoin2024}{Yaffe-Bellany,
2024}).

As mentioned earlier, a key characteristic of cryptocurrencies is their
high volatility, which greatly exceeds that of other traditional assets
such as equity indices, gold, silver, foreign exchange currencies, and
commodities (\citeproc{ref-conlonAreCryptocurrencies2020}{Conlon et al.,
2020}; \citeproc{ref-kleinBitcoinNot2018}{Klein et al., 2018}).
According to the standard asset pricing theory, investors should be
compensated for bearing such risks. The principle that higher risk
should be associated with higher expected returns is central in finance,
beginning with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of Sharpe
(\citeproc{ref-sharpeCapitalAsset1964}{1964}) and Lintner
(\citeproc{ref-lintnerValuationRisk1965}{1965}), and later extended by
Merton (\citeproc{ref-mertonIntertemporalCapital1973}{1973}), who
introduced state variables to capture changes in investment and
consumption decisions through the intertemporal CAPM, and by Ross
(\citeproc{ref-rossArbitrageTheory1976}{1976}), who formalized
multi-factor risk pricing through the arbitrage pricing theory (APT). In
particular, the APT shows that, in the absence of arbitrage
opportunities, asset returns can be represented by a linear factor
model, where returns are explained by their exposures to systematic risk
factors. In empirical applications, this relation is often estimated
through time-series regressions
(\citeproc{ref-cochrane2009asset}{Cochrane, 2005}). Let
\(r_{i,t+1} \in \mathbb{R}\) denote the excess return on asset \(i\)
from period \(t-1\) to \(t\), for \(i = 1, ..., N\) and
\(t = 1, ..., T\). Let \(f_{t+1} \in \mathbb{R}^K\) be a \(K \times 1\)
vector of risk factors. The model can then be written as\\
\[
r_{i,t} = \alpha_{i,t-1} + \beta_{i,t-1}' f_{t} + \epsilon_{i,t},
\] where \(\beta_{i,t-1} \in \mathbb{R}^K\) measures the exposure of
asset \(i\) to the risk factors, \(\alpha_{i,t-1}\) represents a pricing
error (equal to zero under correct specification), and
\(\epsilon_{i,t}\) is the idiosyncratic component of returns.

A major challenge of the framework described above is identifying the
set of factors that best capture asset returns, as these factors are not
directly observable. This raises the question of whether they truly
explain the cross-section of excess returns or whether such returns
should instead be attributed to asset mispricing. This motivates the
main questions addressed in this thesis:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Which factors account for the variation in cryptocurrency returns?
\item
  To what extend can the return cross-section be explained by systematic
  risk factors?
\item
  Does allowing for dynamic factor loadings improve the prediction of
  cross-sectional excess returns?
\end{itemize}

The main goal of this thesis is to apply established factor models from
the financial literature to a large panel of cryptocurrency data and to
compare their predictive performance under static and dynamic loadings.
In particular, I replicate the approaches of Kelly et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}) and Bianchi \& Babiak
(\citeproc{ref-bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021}{2021b}) for the
cryptocurrency market. The analysis relies on a model that allows factor
loadings to vary over time through observable characteristics, using the
Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) methodology.

\section{Literature review}\label{literature-review}

Linear factor pricing models play a fundamental role in the field of
finance. Building on the theoretical foundations of APT, a large body of
academic research have worked to identify the sources of economic risks
and the factors that explain the cross-section of asset returns. Broadly
speaking, two main strands have emerged in the empirical literature
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{Kelly et al., 2019}).

One strand of the literature pre-specifies the factors \(f_{t+1}\) and
represents them with long-short portfolios, often referred to as
factor-mimicking portfolios or sorted portfolios. These long-short
portfolios are based on well-established knowledge of the empirical
behavior of asset returns and are therefore treated as fully observable
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{Kelly et al., 2019}). The
main drawback of this approach is that it presumes a prior understanding
of the cross-sectional dynamics of asset returns, even though such
knowledge is incomplete or imperfect.

Although the construction of each factor varies across studies, the
process typically involves sorting assets into quintiles (or deciles)
based on a given characteristic and forming the factor return as the
difference between the top and bottom groups. Fama \& French
(\citeproc{ref-famaCommonRisk1993}{1993}) were the first to formalize
this approach in the context of linear factor models, introducing a
three-factor model (FF3) that included the market, size, and value
factors to explain stocks and bond returns. Carhart
(\citeproc{ref-carhartPersistenceMutual1997}{1997}) expanded the FF3 by
adding a momentum factor, which captures the one-year asset momentum,
forming in this way a 4-factor model. Later, Fama \& French
(\citeproc{ref-famaFivefactorAsset2015}{2015}) extended the FF3 by
incorporating profitability and investment factors, creating a 5-factor
model to capture additional stock return variation beyond size and
value.

The number of risk factors proposed in the literature is vast, with
hundreds of them reported across different studies
(\citeproc{ref-cochranePresidentialAddress2011}{Cochrane, 2011};
\citeproc{ref-harveyLuckyFactors2021}{Harvey \& Liu, 2021}). Feng et al.
(\citeproc{ref-fengTamingFactor2020}{2020}) developed a model selection
framework to evaluate the contribution of newly proposed factors,
finding that most are redundant relative to existing ones. Hou et al.
(\citeproc{ref-houReplicatingAnomalies2020}{2020}) and A. Y. Chen \&
Zimmermann (\citeproc{ref-chenOpenSource2021}{2021}) replicated 452 and
319 long-short strategies from the literature, respectively. Hou et
al.~failed to reproduce the results of more than half of predictors in
their set, finding most of them statistically insignificant and
concluding that many published return predictors are not reliable. By
contrast, Chen and Zimmerman showed that nearly all of the literature
results can be successfully replicated.

A second strand of research views the factors as latent and applies
data-compression techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA),
to simultaneously extract common factors and estimate their betas
directly from the panel of realized returns
(\citeproc{ref-bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021}{Bianchi \& Babiak,
2021b}). This method derives factors purely from a statistical criteria
and therefore requires no prior knowledge of the cross-sectional
behavior of returns. Its main limitation, however, is that PCA can only
estimate static loadings, implying that asset exposures to systematic
risk are assumed constant over time. Moreover, PCA cannot incorporate
additional information beyond returns, which restricts its ability to
identify more appropriate asset pricing models
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{Kelly et al., 2019}).

The pioneers in this approach are Chamberlain \& Rothschild
(\citeproc{ref-chamberlainArbitrageFactor1983}{1983}) and Connor \&
Korajczyk (\citeproc{ref-connorPerformanceMeasurement1986}{1986}).
Chamberlain \& Rothschild
(\citeproc{ref-chamberlainArbitrageFactor1983}{1983}) defined the
concept of approximate factor structure and showed that asset returns on
large markets can be represented by a small number of common factors
that can be extracted with PCA, as long as the covariance matrix of
asset returns has \(K\) unbounded eigenvalues. Building on this, Connor
\& Korajczyk (\citeproc{ref-connorPerformanceMeasurement1986}{1986})
developed an econometric method using asymptotic principal components
that estimates latent factors and their loadings from large panels of
returns, providing consistent APT-based performance measures and an
application to portfolio evaluation.

More recently, Kelly et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}) introduced the
Instrumented PCA (IPCA). Unlike PCA, which assumes static factor
loadings, IPCA allows loadings to vary with observable asset
characteristics such as size, volatility, or momentum. These
characteristics serve as instruments for conditional loadings, enabling
the method to incorporate more information than returns alone and to
handle unbalanced panels of data. Bali et al.
(\citeproc{ref-baliJointFactor2023}{2023}) extended the IPCA approach to
a joint factor model that explains the risk-return trade-off across
different asset classes --bonds, stocks, and options--. In a related
work, Z. Chen et al. (\citeproc{ref-chenCommonRisk2024}{2024}) proposed
the Regressed PCA (RPCA), which extracts common latent factors across
stocks, bonds, and options by combining cross-sectional Fama--MacBeth
regressions (\citeproc{ref-famaRiskReturn1973}{Fama \& MacBeth, 1973})
on asset characteristics with standard PCA.

While most of the literature has focused on understanding stock market
returns, a growing body of research has examined the dynamics of
cryptocurrency returns. Inspired by the FF3 model in equities, Y. Liu et
al. (\citeproc{ref-liuCommonRisk2022}{2022}) and W. Liu et al.
(\citeproc{ref-liuCommonRisk2020}{2020}) construct a similar
three-factor model for cryptocurrency returns using market, size, and
momentum factors. Using weekly data, they show that this model captures
a large share of cryptocurrency returns and, in particular, reveals
strong anomaly effects in the momentum and size factors. However, Jung
\& Park (\citeproc{ref-jungCommonFactors2024}{2024}) show that the
three-factor model of Y. Liu et al.
(\citeproc{ref-liuCommonRisk2022}{2022}) explains only about one-third
of cryptocurrency return variation. They attribute the remaining
variation to a common component outside the three-factor model, closely
linked to the value of fiat money, highlighting the role of global
macroeconomic variables in cryptocurrency pricing. Further work by Y.
Liu \& Tsyvinski (\citeproc{ref-liuRisksReturns2021}{2021}) shows that
cryptocurrency returns are also linked to network factors, which capture
user adoption. They also find strong momentum effects and show that
investor attention can predict future returns. Building on these
findings, Cong et al. (\citeproc{ref-congValuePremium2022}{2022}) show
that value and network adoption provide strong risk premia across more
than 4,000 cryptocurrencies. They propose a five-factor ``C-5'' model
--market, size, momentum, value, and network--that performs better than
earlier models in- and out-of-sample, and also report market
segmentation across different categories of cryptocurrencies.

Studies adopting a latent-factor structure include Bouri et al.
(\citeproc{ref-bouriForecastingReturns2022}{2022}) and Bianchi \& Babiak
(\citeproc{ref-bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021}{2021b}). Bouri et
al. (\citeproc{ref-bouriForecastingReturns2022}{2022}) apply a
regime-switching factor model, where the comovement of cryptocurrency
returns depends on market states. They show that accounting for these
state-dependent comovements improves the forecasting performance of
major cryptocurrencies compared to standard PCA and a random-walk model.
In contrast, Bianchi \& Babiak
(\citeproc{ref-bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021}{2021b}) apply the
IPCA model to the cryptocurrency market, constructing 32 characteristics
to instrument the dynamic factor loadings. They show that this
time-varying latent-factor framework measures the variation in realized
returns more accurately than conventional observable-factor models or
standard PCA, both at the daily and weekly frequency. They also find
that characteristics related to speculative demand and liquidity are the
most significant in capturing the systematic mispricing of returns.

\section{Data concerns}\label{data-concerns}

One of the main challenges in this thesis was obtaining a large panel of
cryptocurrency data. I extracted market data from the free
\href{https://coincodex.com/}{CoinCodex} API, which provides access to
the full historical data of the cryptocurrencies listed on its platform.
In contrast, most crypto market data providers --also called
coin-ranking sites, such as CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, CryptoCompare
(CoinDesk)-- offer limited access to historical data (usually one year)
or none at all without a paid subscription. Some exchange platforms,
such as Bybit, Binance, Coinbase, and Cex, allow users to extract market
data for free through their public APIs. However, the number of
cryptocurrencies (and thus, the cross-section) available from these
sources was relatively small compared with CoinCoidex, and the time span
was shorter \footnote{For example, Bitcoin data started from late 2013
  in CoinCodex, compared to November, 2022 in Bybit, January, 2019, in
  Binance, and June, 2021, in Coinbase. The available cryptocurrencies
  paired with Tether USD (USD) were 763 in Bybit, 623 in Binance, and
  116 (USD) in Coinbase.}.

The choice of which data source is appropriate for scientific research
is subject to debate. For example, Alexander \& Dakos
(\citeproc{ref-alexanderCriticalInvestigation2020}{2020}) examine
different cryptocurrency data providers and find inconsistencies in
regression estimates, suggesting that the source of cryptocurrency data
can influence empirical results. Moreover, they document distorted coin
prices on coin-ranking sites, caused by inflated or artificial trading
volumes\footnote{Coin-ranking sites rank coins and exchanges by trading
  volume and market capitalization. As highlighted by Alexander \& Dakos
  (\citeproc{ref-alexanderCriticalInvestigation2020}{2020}), the prices
  quoted on some of these sites are calculated by aggregating the prices
  from hundreds of exchanges using a volume-weighted average. Because
  many exchanges artificially inflate their volume to boost their
  position in the rankings, the resulting aggregated prices are
  influenced by fake volumes and therefore inconsistent with traded
  prices.}, emphasizing the importance of using traded data from crypto
exchanges. By contrast, Vidal-Tomás
(\citeproc{ref-vidal-tomasWhichCryptocurrency2022}{2022}) argue that
coin-ranking sites use the same underlying process as crypto exchanges
and other platforms to compute a cryptocurrency price, and they report
no significant differences in empirical results when using alternative
data sources. To address these concerns, I apply a series of
pre-processing filters, described in Section~\ref{sec-data}, to mitigate
the impact of potential inaccuracies in my dataset.

The remainder of the thesis is structured as follows. Section 2
summarizes the IPCA model, the estimation strategy and the performance
measures applied in the analysis. Section 3 describes the data
extraction and the sample construction process. Section 4 presents the
empirical findings, and Section 5 concludes.

\chapter{Methodology}\label{sec-methodology}

In this section, I present the main method used in this thesis:
Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA), introduced by Kelly et
al. (\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}). IPCA estimates
latent factors and dynamic factor loadings by linking them to observable
asset-specific characteristics. Unlike standard PCA, which assumes
static loadings and relies uniquely on return data, IPCA allows factors
loadings to vary with asset characteristics, such as size, volatility,
volume, or momentum, which act as instruments for the conditional
loadings. Moreover, it enables the estimation of \(K\) factor loadings
directly from the panel of asset characteristics. Another advantage is
that IPCA can be applied to unbalanced panels, which is particularly
useful in the cryptocurrency market where new coins are regularly
introduced and others become inactive or unavailable, making missing
data in the cross-section very common.

\section{IPCA model and estimation}\label{ipca-model-and-estimation}

Consider a linear factor model. Let \(r_{i,t+1} \in \mathbb{R}\) denote
the excess return on cryptocurrency \(i\) from period \(t\) to \(t+1\),
for \(i = 1, \dots, N\) and \(t = 1, \dots, T\). The general IPCA model
specification is defined as
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-ipca}{
r_{i,t+1} = \alpha_{i,t} + \beta_{i,t}' f_{t+1} + \epsilon_{i,t+1},
}\end{equation}

with \[
\alpha_{i,t} = z'_{i,t}\Gamma_\alpha + \nu_{\alpha,i,t}, \quad 
\beta_{i,t} = z'_{i,t}\Gamma_\beta + \nu_{\beta,i,t},
\]

where \(f_{t+1} \in \mathbb{R}^K\) is the \(K \times 1\) vector of
latent factors. The \(K \times 1\) vector \(\beta_{i,t}\) captures the
dynamic factor loadings, which may depend on observable cryptocurrency
characteristics contained in the \(L \times 1\) vector of instruments
\(z_{i,t}\). The main idea is that linking model parameters to
observable characteristics allows expected returns to adjust more
quickly to new information than when using parameter estimates from
rolling window time-series regressions
(\citeproc{ref-bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021}{Bianchi \& Babiak,
2021b}). This link is captured through the \(L \times K\) matrix
\(\Gamma_\beta\), which maps a potentially large number of
cryptocurrency characteristics \(L\) into a small number \(K\) of latent
factor loadings. Similarly, the \(L \times 1\) vector \(\Gamma_\alpha\)
maps characteristics to anomaly intercepts. Finally, the terms
\(\nu_{\alpha, i, t}\) and \(\nu_{\beta, i, t}\) are residuals that
capture variation in loadings orthogonal to the observable instruments.

In IPCA, two specifications can be considered. As discussed earlier,
characteristics are used as instruments for the time-variation in
conditional loadings, so that the mapping
\(z_{i,t} \mapsto \beta_{i,t}\) is determined by the low-dimensional
matrix \(\Gamma_\beta\). A distinction is then made between a restricted
and an unrestricted specification. The restricted model imposes
\(\Gamma_\alpha = \mathbf{0}\) and assumes that characteristics affect
expected returns only through risk exposures, which means there are no
``anomaly'' intercepts. In contrast, the unrestricted model sets
\(\Gamma_\alpha \neq \mathbf{0}\), with \(\alpha_{i,t}\) capturing mean
returns from characteristics that are not determined by risk exposures
alone.

For the restricted model (\(\Gamma_\alpha = \mathbf{0}\)),
Equation~\ref{eq-ipca} can be rewritten in vector form as

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-restricted}{
r_{t+1} = Z_t\Gamma_{\beta}f_{t+1} + \epsilon^*_{t+1},
}\end{equation}

where \(r_{t+1}\) is an \(N \times 1\) vector of individual
cryptocurrency returns, \(Z_t\) is the \(N \times L\) matrix of stacked
characteristics, and
\(\epsilon^*_{t+1} = \epsilon_{t+1} + \nu_{\alpha,t} + \nu_{\beta,t}f_{t+1}\)
is a composite error vector stacking individual residuals. The
estimation problem is to minimize the sum of squared composite model
errors:

\[
\min_{\Gamma_\beta, F} \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} 
\left(r_{t+1} - Z_t \Gamma_\beta f_{t+1}\right)^{\prime}
\left(r_{t+1} - Z_t \Gamma_\beta f_{t+1}\right)
\]

The solution is obtained by alternating least squares, iterating the
first-order conditions of \(f_{t+1}\) and \(\Gamma_\beta\)
(\citeproc{ref-bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021}{Bianchi \& Babiak,
2021b}):

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-condition1}{
\hat{f}_{t+1} = \left(\hat{\Gamma}_\beta^{\prime} Z_t^{\prime} Z_t \hat{\Gamma}_\beta \right)^{-1}
\hat{\Gamma}_\beta^{\prime} Z_t^{\prime} r_{t+1}, 
\quad \forall t
}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-condition2}{
\operatorname{vec}(\hat{\Gamma}_\beta) =
\left(
\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} Z_t^{\prime} Z_t \otimes \hat{f}_{t+1} \hat{f}_{t+1}^{\prime}
\right)^{-1}
\left(
\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \left[ Z_t \otimes \hat{f}_{t+1} \right]^{\prime} r_{t+1}
\right)
}\end{equation}

In this sense, ALS alternates between estimating factor realizations via
cross-sectional regressions on latent loadings
(Equation~\ref{eq-condition1}) and updating \(\Gamma_\beta\) through
regressions on factors interacted with characteristics
(Equation~\ref{eq-condition2}).

Similarly, the unrestricted model (\(\Gamma_\alpha \neq \mathbf{0}\))
can be rewritten in vector form as

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-unrestricted}{
r_{t+1} = Z_t\tilde{\Gamma}\tilde{f}_{t+1} + \epsilon^*_{t+1},
}\end{equation}

where \(\tilde\Gamma = [\Gamma_\alpha, \Gamma_\beta]\) and
\(\tilde{f}_{t+1} = [1, f'_{t+1}]'\). Note that the unrestricted model
simply augments the factor specification to include a constant. The
first-order conditions slightly change to

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-condition3}{
f_{t+1} = \left(\Gamma_\beta^{\prime} Z_t^{\prime} Z_t \Gamma_\beta \right)^{-1} \Gamma_\beta^{\prime} Z_t^{\prime} \left(r_{t+1} - Z_t \Gamma_\alpha \right), \quad \forall t, 
}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-condition4}{
\operatorname{vec}(\tilde{\Gamma}) =
\left(
\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} Z_t^{\prime} Z_t \otimes \tilde{f}_{t+1} \tilde{f}_{t+1}^{\prime}
\right)^{-1}
\left(
\sum_{t=1}^{T-1} \left[ Z_t \otimes \tilde{f}_{t+1} \right]^{\prime} r_{t+1}
\right)
}\end{equation}

In the unrestricted model, the intercept captures only the part of mean
returns that is not already explained by factor loadings. In other
words, it accounts for the residual variation in expected returns that
characteristics cannot map into risk exposures.

\subsection{Interpretation as a managed
portfolio}\label{interpretation-as-a-managed-portfolio}

As discussed in Kelly et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}), the asset pricing
literature traditionally evaluates pricing factor performance using test
portfolios, such as the value-sorted portfolios in the Fama-French data
library \footnote{see
  https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data\_library.html},
rather than individual assets. These portfolios reduce idiosyncratic
variation by averaging across many securities. Kelly et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}) show that the IPCA
framework provides an analogous representation through
characteristic-managed portfolios. Each managed portfolio is constructed
by a weighted average of asset returns, where the weights are given by
their observable characteristics. For \(L\) asset-specific
characteristics, the \(L \times 1\) vector of managed portfolio returns
is

\[
x_{t+1} = \frac{1}{N_{t+1}} Z_t'r_{t+1},
\]

where \(Z_t\) is the \(N \times L\) matrix of characteristics at time
\(t\), \(r_{t+1}\) is the \(N \times 1\) vector of realized asset
returns, and \(N_{t+1}\) is the number of available assets.

Although the main focus of this thesis is on explaining the relationship
between cryptocurrency returns and common risk factors using the panel
of individual cryptocurrencies, I also report results for models
estimated with characteristic-managed portfolios.

\section{Performance measures}\label{performance-measures}

Kelly et al. (\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}) propose
two metrics to evaluate and compare the asset pricing performance of the
IPCA model across different choices of \(K\) factors and between
restricted and unrestricted specifications. These measures are referred
to as the total \(R^2\) and the predictive \(R^2\). However, since both
statistics can take negative values ---although ``\(R^2\)'' suggests
non-negative values---I refer to them here as the ``total score'' and
the ``predictive score''.

The total score measures the overall fit of the IPCA model by
quantifying how much of the variation in realized returns can be
explained by the estimated factors and conditional loadings. It is
defined as

\[
\text{Total Score} = 1 - 
\frac{\sum_{i,t} \left(r_{i,t+1} - z_{i,t}'(\hat{\Gamma}_\alpha + \hat{\Gamma}_\beta \hat{f}_{t+1})\right)^2}
{\sum_{i,t} r_{i,t+1}^2}.
\]\\
The predictive score measures how much of the variation in realized
returns is explained by the model's conditional expected returns,
obtained by replacing realized factors with the estimated risk prices
\(\hat \lambda\). It is defined as

\[
\text{Predictive Score} = 1 - 
\frac{\sum_{i,t} \left(r_{i,t+1} - z_{i,t}'(\hat{\Gamma}_\alpha + \hat{\Gamma}_\beta \hat{\lambda})\right)^2}
{\sum_{i,t} r_{i,t+1}^2},
\]\\
In the restricted specification (\(\Gamma_\alpha = 0\)), the predictive
score describes how well characteristics explain expected returns only
through their effect on factor loadings, that is, through systematic
risk exposures. In the unrestricted specification, the predictive score
measures how well characteristics explain expected returns both through
factor loadings and through anomaly intercepts.

\section{Hypothesis tests}\label{hypothesis-tests}

Kelly et al. (\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}) develop
three hypothesis tests that help determine the whether one specification
significantly improves the model description of asset returns.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Asset pricing test
\(\Gamma_\alpha = \mathbf{0}\)}{Asset pricing test \textbackslash Gamma\_\textbackslash alpha = \textbackslash mathbf\{0\}}}\label{asset-pricing-test-gamma_alpha-mathbf0}

The first hypothesis test evaluates whether anomaly intercepts capture
variation in returns beyond systematic risk exposures. In the
unrestricted specification in Equation~\ref{eq-unrestricted}, expected
returns are modeled as a linear function of both factor loadings and
anomaly intercepts. The null hypothesis is \[
H_0 = \Gamma_\alpha = \mathbf{0}_{L \times 1}
\] against the alternative \[
H_1 = \Gamma_\alpha \neq \mathbf{0}_{L \times 1}
\] If the null is not rejected, characteristics influence expected
returns only through factor loadings, and alphas are not associated with
the characteristics in \(z_{i,t}\). Rejecting the null indicates that
characteristics help explain average returns directly through anomaly
intercepts, in addition to their role in determining exposures to risk.

Following Kelly et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}), the null hypothesis
is tested using a Wald-type statistic, which evaluates the distance
between the restricted and unrestricted models as the sum of squared
elements of the estimated \(\Gamma_\alpha\) vector:
\[W_\alpha = \hat\Gamma^{\prime}_\alpha\hat\Gamma_\alpha\] Inference is
carried out using a bootstrap procedure. After estimating the
unrestricted model and retaining \(\hat\Gamma_\alpha\),
\(\hat\Gamma_\beta\), and \({\{\hat f_t}\}_{t=1}^T\), the managed
portfolio residuals are constructed as
\(d_{t+1} = Z_t^\prime \epsilon^*_{t+1}\) from the managed portfolio
definition \[
x_{t+1} = Z_t^\prime r_{t+1} = (Z_t^\prime Z_t)\Gamma_\alpha + (Z_t^\prime Z_t)\Gamma_\beta f_{t+1} + Z_t^\prime \epsilon^*_{t+1}
\]

These residuals are resampled and the fitted values
\({\{\hat d_t}\}_{t=1}^T\) stored. Then, for each bootstrap replication
\(b=1, \dots, 1000\), a new sample of portfolio returns is generated as
\[
\tilde x_{t+1}^b = (Z_t^\prime Z_t)\hat \Gamma_\beta \hat{f}_{t+1} + \tilde d^b_{t+1}, \quad
\tilde d^b_{t+1} = q_{1,t+1}^b \hat{d}_{q^b_{2,t+1}}
\] Here, \(q_{2,t+1}^b\) is a random time index drawn uniformly from the
set of all possible dates, and \(q_{1,t+1}^b\) is a Student-\(t\) random
variable with unit variance and five degrees of freedom. Using these
bootstrap samples, the unrestricted model is re-estimated and the
statistic recomputed as \[
\tilde{W}^b_\alpha = \tilde\Gamma^{b\prime}_\alpha\tilde\Gamma^b_\alpha
\] Finally, the empirical \(p\)-value is obtained as the fraction of
bootstrap statistics \(\tilde W_\alpha^b\) that exceed the observed
value \(W_\alpha\) from the actual data.

\subsubsection{Testing instruments
significance}\label{testing-instruments-significance}

This test evaluates whether a specific characteristic significantly
contributes to factor loadings after controlling for all other
characteristics. The analysis is based on the restricted model with
\(\Gamma_\alpha = 0\), where the goal is to assess whether the
\(l^{th}\) characteristic helps explain the conditional loadings
\(\beta_{i,t}\). For this, first, the loading matrix is written as \[
\Gamma_\beta = [\gamma_{\beta, 1}, \dots,\gamma_{\beta,L}]^\prime,
\] with \(\gamma_{\beta,l}\) denoting the \(K \times 1\) vector of
coefficients linking characteristic \(l\) to the \(K\) latent factors.
Under the null hypothesis, the \(l^{th}\) characteristic plays no role
in determining exposures, so its entire row is set to zero: \[
H_0 : \Gamma_\beta = [\gamma_{\beta, 1}, \dots, \gamma_{\beta, l-1}, \mathbf{0}_{K \times 1}, \gamma_{\beta, l+1}, \dots, \gamma_{\beta, L}]
\] against the alternative allowing for a non-zero contribution from
characteristic \(l\). \[
H_1 : \Gamma_\beta = [\gamma_{\beta, 1}, \dots,\gamma_{\beta,L}]^\prime,
\] The Wald-type statistic used to evaluate this hypothesis is \[
W_{\beta,l} = \hat\gamma^\prime_{\beta,l}\hat\gamma_{\beta,l}
\] Inference is based on the same residual bootstrap procedure as in the
alpha test. One thousand bootstrap samples are generated under the null
hypothesis that the \(l^{th}\) characteristic has no effect on factor
loadings, the portfolio returns is re-estimated for each sample, and the
corresponding statistics \(\tilde W_{\beta,l}^b\) are computed. The
\(p\)-value is obtained as the fraction of bootstrap statistics that
exceed the observed \(W_{\beta,l}\).

\subsubsection{Testing pre-specified
factors}\label{testing-pre-specified-factors}

In addition to estimating latent factors, the IPCA can nest
pre-specified, common observable factors, to compare against a the
general IPCA specification. Following Kelly et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}), the models can be
implemented as (i) the traditional time-series approach with static
loadings estimated asset-by-asset on the observable factors, and (ii) an
instrumented version that keeps the factor returns fixed but
parameterizes loadings as functions of characteristics. Therefore, the
second specification is a combination between pre-specifying observable
factors in the IPCA model, and estimating its loadings dynamically, for
each period \(t\), or even generate latent factors additional to the
pre-specified ones. The model is written as

In addition to estimating latent factors, IPCA can also incorporate
pre-specified observable factors, allowing direct comparison with the
general specification. Following Kelly et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}), two versions can be
implemented: (i) the traditional time-series approach with static
loadings estimated asset-by-asset on the observable factors, and (ii) an
instrumented version that fixes the factor returns but models loadings
as functions of characteristics. The latter combines pre-specified
observable factors with the IPCA structure, since loadings are estimated
dynamically each period \(t\), while additional latent factors may also
be generated alongside the pre-specified ones. The model takes the form
\[
r_{i,t+1} = \beta_{i,t}f_{t+1} + \delta_{i,t}g_{t+1} + \epsilon_{i,t+1},
\] with \[
\delta_{i,t} = z^{\prime}_{i,t}\Gamma_\delta + \nu_{\delta,i,t},
\] where the term \(\delta_{i,t} g_{t+1}\) captures the contribution of
the \(M \times 1\) vector of observable factors \(g_{t+1}\), and
\(\Gamma_\delta\) is the \(L \times M\) mapping from characteristics to
their loadings. Estimation proceeds as in the unrestricted case, but now
with \(\tilde\Gamma = [\Gamma_\beta, \Gamma_\delta]\) and
\(\tilde{f}{t+1} = [f^{\prime}{t+1}, g^{\prime}_{t+1}]^\prime\). The
first-order condition in Equation~\ref{eq-condition4} remains the same,
while Equation~\ref{eq-condition3} becomes
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-condition5}{
f_{t+1} = \left(\Gamma_\beta^{\prime} Z_t^{\prime} Z_t \Gamma_\beta \right)^{-1} \Gamma_\beta^{\prime} Z_t^{\prime} \left(r_{t+1} - Z_t \Gamma_\delta g_{t+1} \right), \quad \forall t. 
}\end{equation} Kelly et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}) propose a test to
assess the explanatory power of observable factors after controlling for
the baseline IPCA specification. The null hypothesis states that
observable factors add no additional explanatory power \[
H_0:\Gamma_\delta = \mathbf{0}_{L \times M}, 
\] against the alternative
\[H_1:\Gamma_\delta \neq \mathbf{0}_{L \times M}\] The Wald-type
statistic used to evaluate this hypothesis is \[
W_{\delta} = vec(\hat\Gamma_{\delta})^\prime vec(\hat\Gamma_{\delta})\
\] which measures the distance between the specification that includes
observable factors and the restricted model that excludes them. A large
\(W_\delta\) suggests that observable factors provide incremental
explanatory power for asset returns after accounting for the latent IPCA
factors. Inference is based on the same residual bootstrap procedure as
in the previous tests, using \(b=1,\dots,1000\) bootstrap samples.

\chapter{Data}\label{sec-data}

In this section, I introduce the cryptocurrency data used in this
thesis, and describe the series of filters applied to clean and prepare
the dataset, and the summary statistics of the cryptocurrency excess
returns. In addition, I present the set of asset-specific
characteristics constructed from the cryptocurrency market data, which
are used as instruments for latent factor exposures in the IPCA model.
Finally, I construct a set of observable risk factors, or
factor-mimicking portfolios, which are used as pre-specified factors in
the analysis. Appendix~\ref{sec-app_characteristics} and
\ref{sec-obs_factors} provides a detailed description of the set of
characteristics and factors, respectively.

The data extraction and pre-processing are primarily conducted in R
4.5.1 (\citeproc{ref-base}{R Core Team, 2025}), using, among other
packages\footnote{See Appendix~\ref{sec-software} for the full list of
  software used in the empirical study.}, the \texttt{tidyverse} (v.
2.0.0; \citeproc{ref-tidyverse}{Wickham et al., 2019}). Additional
cleaning steps and visualizations are performed in Python 3.13.5
(\citeproc{ref-python}{Python Software Foundation, 2025}). The full
reproducible code is available in Appendix \ref{sec-app_material}.

\section{Data extraction and sample
construction}\label{data-extraction-and-sample-construction}

I collect daily cryptocurrency data on open, high, close, and low (OHCL)
prices, 24-hour volume, and market capitalization (calculated as the
cryptocurrency's USD price multiplied by its circulating supply) from
\href{https://coincodex.com/}{CoinCodex}, a website-data provider that
gathers and aggregates data from more than 400 exchanges. I extract the
data, all expressed in US dollars, using the CoinCodex API as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  I retrieve the list of all available cryptocurrencies and extract each
  cryptocurrency shortname, also referred to as the ``slug''. At the
  time of writing, there are 14,907 unique cryptocurrency shortnames
  listed in the API.
\item
  Using the slug, I construct an URL for each cryptocurrency to obtain
  the metadata from the API. I parse the JSON API response into a
  dataframe and extract the OHCL prices, volume, and market
  capitalization daily data. I exclude those observations with non-zero
  or missing values in any of these fields.
\end{enumerate}

Out of the 14,907 cryptocurrencies listed, only 7,272 entries contained
available data. Next, following the methodology of Bianchi \& Babiak
(\citeproc{ref-bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021}{2021b}) and Mercik
et al.
(\citeproc{ref-mercikCrosssectionalInteractionsCryptocurrency2025}{2025}),
I apply a series of cleaning and filtering steps in order to remove
possible innacuracies in the dataset:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Non-positive and missing values. As mentioned earlier, I remove
  observations where prices, volume, or market capitalization were
  non-positive or missing.
\item
  Small cryptocurrencies. Similar to Y. Liu et al.
  (\citeproc{ref-liuCommonRisk2022}{2022}), I screen out small
  cryptocurrencies and consider only those with a market capitalization
  greater than one million USD. Therefore, I exclude observations for
  coins whose market capitalization falls below this minimum threshold,
  which allows for the possibility that a coin may become ``small''
  after a certain period or event.
\item
  Cryptocurrency type. Based on the cryptocurrency classification from
  \href{https://coinmarketcap.com/cryptocurrency-category/}{CoinMarketCap}
  and CoinCodex, I exclude:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    stablecoins. I include (i) centralized stablecoins, which are backed
    and pegged to fiat currency or physical assets by a third party,
    such as Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Euro Coin (EURC), and
    (ii) algorithmically stabilized stablecoins, which use algorithms to
    adjust the circulating supply in response to changes in demand to
    maintain a stable value with the underlying asset, such as DAI and
    AMPL (FSB,
    \citeproc{ref-financialstabilityboardAddressingRegulatory2020}{2020}).
  \item
    wrapped cryptocurrency tokens, which mirror the value of another
    cryptocurrency from a different blockchain, e.g., Wrapped Bitcoin
    (wBTC) or Wrapped Ethereum (wETH)
    (\citeproc{ref-coinbaseWhatWrapped}{Coinbase, n.d.}).
  \item
    cryptocurrencies backed by or pegged to gold or precious metals,
    including Pax Gold (PAXG) or XAGx Silver Token (XAGX).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Erroneous trading volume. To filter out cryptocurrencies with ``fake''
  or ``erroneous'' trading volume, I calculate the daily
  volume-to-market-capitalization ratio for each token and exclude
  observations where the ratio exceeds 1.
\item
  Extreme returns. To minimize the influence of extreme values in my
  results, I winsorize daily cryptocurrency returns to lie within the
  range of -90\% to 500\%.
\item
  Time period. Even though cryptocurrency data are available since 2014,
  I use data from June 1, 2018 for the empirical analysis due to the low
  amount of coins available before this date (see
  Figure~\ref{fig-numcoins}).
\item
  Minimum observations. In order to maintain practical relevance, I keep
  cryptocurrencies that have at least 365 consecutive daily observations
  and those with at least 730 observations in the complete panel of coin
  characteristics (see Section~\ref{sec-characteristics}), which is
  equivalent to 2 years of historical data. Therefore, I exclude very
  short-lived coins, but retain failed coins with this relatively large
  number of observations, which help to lessen the so called
  ``survivorship biais''.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sample overview}\label{sample-overview}

After applying all the filters, the resulting sample consists of 973
unique cryptocurrencies and 1,478,936 observations from June 1, 2018, to
July 31, 2025, where a day starts at 00:00:00 UTC. It is important to
mention that the number of cryptocurrencies fluctuates over the entire
period, which results in an unbalanced panel of data. Table
\ref{tbl-cross_section} provides a description of the yearly
cross-sectionional statistics: the sample starts with 254 different
cryptocurrencies in 2018 and peaks in 2023 with 939 unique
cryptocurrencies, before decreasing to 780 in 2025. The minimum daily
cross-section is 121 in 2018, and then increases drastically up to 793
in 2023. For context, at the time of writing, CoinMarketCap tracks
around 19 million cryptocurrencies, and CoinGecko around 19 thousands.
When compared to these numbers, the size of the sample may seem small;
however, it actually covers most of the whole cryptocurrency market
capitalization (see Figure~\ref{fig-samplemarketcap}). The sample period
includes important events in the market, such as

Table \ref{tbl-overview} summarizes the descriptive statistics for the
cryptocurrency daily returns across different subsamples and Bitcoin,
Ethereum, and Ripple, which are the three largest cryptocurrencies in
the sample. Interestingly, the larger samples exhibit a larger
volatility and more pronounced extreme returns, both positive and
negative. Bitcoin shows the lowest mean return during the sample period
(0.16\% per day), though this value very close to that of Ethereum
(0.17\%) and Ripple (0.20\%), and only slightly below other
cryptocurrency subsamples.

the Palestine-Israel war in October 2023. More recently, in 2024, the
U.S. Secutities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing and
trading of several crypto spot ETFs in January, and Donald Trump's

\section{Characteristic construction and
description}\label{sec-characteristics}

For the analysis, I construct 41 asset-specific characteristics from the
cross-section of 973 cryptocurrencies using data on prices, volume, and
market capitalization. Specifically, I follow the methodology of Bianchi
\& Babiak (\citeproc{ref-bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021}{2021b}),
Y. Liu et al. (\citeproc{ref-liuCommonRisk2022}{2022}), and Mercik et
al.
(\citeproc{ref-mercikCrosssectionalInteractionsCryptocurrency2025}{2025})
to construct the set of characteristics widely used in the
cryptocurrency and financial literature, which serve as return
predictors in the empirical analysis. These characteristics are grouped
into six categories: market and size, volatility and risk, trading
activity, liquidity, past returns, and distribution. Table
\ref{tbl-characteristics} summarizes the set of characteristics, while
Appendix \ref{sec-app_characteristics} provides detailed definitions and
construction procedures.

\section{Observable risk factors}\label{observable-risk-factors}

In addition to the set of characteristics described above, I construct a
set of observable risk factors. In the asset pricing literature, the
convention is to analyze the risk compensation of asset returns using
factor-mimicking portfolio (e.g.
\citeproc{ref-carhartPersistenceMutual1997}{Carhart, 1997};
\citeproc{ref-famaCommonRisk1993}{Fama \& French, 1993},
\citeproc{ref-famaFivefactorAsset2015}{2015}). This typically involves
sorting assets cross-sectionally into quintiles based on a specific
characteristic and forming a factor return, calculated as the difference
in returns between the top and the bottom quintiles. This approach
replicates a strategy that buys the portfolio of assets with high values
of a particular characteristic (long), and sells the portfolio with the
lowest values (short).

Building on this methodology, I construct a series of observable risk
factors that prior literature have shown to explain the cross-section of
cryptocurrency returns. Specifically, I include the market, size,
momentum, liquidity, and volatility factors, following Y. Liu et al.
(\citeproc{ref-liuCommonRisk2022}{2022}), Bianchi \& Babiak
(\citeproc{ref-bianchi2021factor}{2021a}), and Lan \& Frömmel
(\citeproc{ref-lanRiskFactors2025}{2025}). Details on their construction
are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec-obs_factors}. As described in
Section~\ref{sec-methodology}, the IPCA allows for the inclusion of
pre-specified factors within the more general model specification. I
make use of this feature and pre-specify the observable factors in the
IPCA model, with and without using asset-characteristics to instrument
for dynamic loadings.

\chapter{Results}\label{results}

Write this in the following section of ``Empirical application'' or This
is for the model: 7. (Still undecisive) Minimum cross-section. Following
the criterion by Kelly, I Convert variables in the -0.5 - 0.5 range

The sample period ranges from January 1st, 2014, to May 31st, 2025.

Implemented in python, based on the IPCA python code of Seth Pruitt
\footnote{See https://sethpruitt.net/research/.} and the \texttt{ipca}
python package of Buechner \& Bybee (\citeproc{ref-ipca}{2019})
\footnote{See https://bkelly-lab.github.io/ipca/.}.

Following Kelly et al.
(\citeproc{ref-kellyCharacteristicsAre2019}{2019}), I cross-sectionally
transform the instrument variables period-by-period in the following
manner: first,

\textbf{Important}: mention the shift of characteristics: the
conditional APT of Kelly, Pruitt, Su (JFE 2019) says that the
characteristics known at Date=d-1 determine the exposures associated
with the returns realized at Date=d; hence, here we should have shifted
the characteristics in Z relative to the returns in R

This is a template of the table of the results of the IPCA model. I need
to add a caption to the table. Here I reference Table

\textbf{Out-of-sample asset pricing performance.}
The table reports out-of-sample total and predictive $R^2$ (in percent) for the IPCA model in Panel A, observable factor models with static loadings in Panel B, and with dynamic loadings in Panel C. Results are shown for $K=1,\dots,6$ factors using both individual cryptocurrency returns ($r_t$) and characteristic-managed portfolios ($x_t$). Observable models start with a CAPM using the market factor ($K=1$) and sequentially add momentum, size, liquidity, and volatility ($K=2,\dots,5$). Out-of-sample performance is based on a recursive scheme with an initial training sample from June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2023, and day-by-day forecasts for the remaining period (about 30\%) until July 31, 2025. All values are reported in percent.

\section{Which characteristics
matter?}\label{which-characteristics-matter}

The figure shows which cryptocurrency characteristics are statistically
significant predictors of factor loadings across IPCA models with
\(K=1,\dots,6\) latent factors. The null hypothesis is that the
coefficients linked to a characteristic, \(\Gamma_{\beta,l}\), are equal
to zero, meaning it has no effect on factor loadings. Significance is
tested while controlling for all other characteristics. Colors indicate
significance at the 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% levels based on Wald-type tests.

The figure shows which cryptocurrency characteristics are significant in
explaining factor loadings across IPCA models with \(K=1,\dots,6\)
latent factors in the restricted model (\(\Gamma_\alpha = \mathbf{0}\)).
The null hypothesis is that the coefficients for a characteristic,
\(\Gamma_{\beta,l}\), are zero, meaning it has no effect once the other
characteristics are controlled for. Colors indicate significance at the
1\%, 5\%, and 10\% levels based on Wald-type tests.

The figure shows which cryptocurrency characteristics are significant in
explaining factor loadings across IPCA models with \(K=1,\dots,6\)
latent factors in the restricted specification
\(\Gamma_\_alpha = \mathbf{0}\). The null hypothesis is that the
coefficients for a characteristic, \(\Gamma_{\beta,l}\), are zero,
meaning it has no effect after controlling for the other

\section{Cryptocurrency Characteristics}\label{sec-app_characteristics}

Following Bianchi \& Babiak
(\citeproc{ref-bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021}{2021b}), Y. Liu et
al. (\citeproc{ref-liuCommonRisk2022}{2022}), and Mercik et al.
(\citeproc{ref-mercikCrosssectionalInteractionsCryptocurrency2025}{2025}),
I construct 41 asset-specific characteristics from OHCL prices, volume,
and market capitalization of each cryptocurrency and group them into six
categories: prize and size, volatility and risk, trading activity,
liquidity, past returns, and distribution. The following list provides
the definition of each characteristic and a description of their
construction.

\subsubsection{Price and size}\label{price-and-size}

\textbf{\texttt{mcap}}. Last day's market capitalization. The market
capitalization is the current cryptocurrency circulating supply
multiplied by its current price in USD.

\textbf{\texttt{prc}}. Last day's logged closing price.

\textbf{\texttt{dh90}}. The closeness to the 90-day high is defined as
the ratio of the last day's price to the maximum price observed over the
past 90 days (e.g., \citeproc{ref-george52WeekHigh2004}{George \& Hwang,
2004}).

\subsubsection{Volatility and risk}\label{volatility-and-risk}

\textbf{\texttt{beta}}. The market beta is calculated as the slope
coefficient from a 30-day rolling regression of cryptocurrency's excess
returns on the market portfolio excess returns (e.g.,
\citeproc{ref-lewellenConditionalCAPM2006}{Lewellen \& Nagel, 2006}).
The coin market portfolio is constructed daily as the value-weighted
average of cryptocurrency returns in the sample.

\textbf{\texttt{ivol}}. Idiosyncratic volatility is computed as the
standard deviation of the residuals from the 30-day rolling CAPM
regression, following the same approach as for \texttt{beta}.

\textbf{\texttt{rvol\_*d}}. Realized volatility, computed using the
estimator of Yang and Zhang (2000) based on OHCL prices. I compute the
daily realized volatility over rolling 7-and 30-day windows, denoted
\texttt{rvol\_7d} and \texttt{rvol\_30d}, respectively. For \(n > 1\)
number of periods, the volatility estimate at time \(t\) is:

\[
\sigma_t = \sqrt{\sigma^2_O + k\sigma^2_C + (1 - k)\sigma^2_{RS}}
\] where \(\sigma^2_{RS}\) is the variance estimator of Rogers et
al.~(1994), and \(\sigma^2_O\), \(\sigma^2_C\), \(k\) are given by

\[
\sigma^2_O = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(o_i - \bar o)^2,
\]

\[
\sigma^2_C = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(c_i - \bar c)^2,
\]

\[
k = \frac{\alpha -1}{\alpha + \frac{n+1}{n-1}}
\]

with \(o = ln\,O_t - ln\,C_{t-1}\), and \(c = ln\,C_t - ln\,O_t\). Here,
\(C_{t-1}\) denotes the previous day's closing price and \(O_t\) the
current day's opening price. I set the constant \(\alpha = 1.34\),
following Yang and Zhang (2000), who recommend this as the best value in
practice.

\textbf{\texttt{retvol}}. Standard deviation of daily returns over the
past 7 days (e.g., \citeproc{ref-angCrossSectionVolatility2006}{Ang et
al., 2006}).

\textbf{\texttt{var}}. The historical Value-at-Risk at the 5\% level,
based on daily returns over the past 90 days.

\textbf{\texttt{es\_5}}. The expected shortfall at the 5\% level, based
on daily returns over the past 90 days.

\textbf{\texttt{delay}}. From the regression \[
R_i - R_f = \alpha^i + \beta^i_{CMKT}CMKT + \beta^i_{CMKT_{-1}}CMKT_{-1} + \beta^i_{CMKT_{-2}}CMKT_{-2} + \epsilon_i, 
\] where \(R_i\) is the return on asset \(i\), \(R_f\) is the risk-free
rate, and \(CMKT\), \(CMKT_{-1}\), and \(CMKT_{-2}\) are the current,
lagged one-and two-day coin market portfolio excess returns,
\texttt{delay} is the improvement in \(R^2\) relative to the standard
CAPM regression using only the current market portfolio excess returns
(e.g., \citeproc{ref-houMarketFrictions2005}{Hou \& Moskowitz, 2005}).
The coin market portfolio is constructed as in \texttt{beta}.

\subsubsection{Trading activity}\label{trading-activity}

\textbf{\texttt{volume}}. Last day's daily trading volume expressed in
US dollars. The trading volume is the total amount of a cryptocurrency
exchanged in a given day, measured in USD.

\textbf{\texttt{volume\_*d}}. The average trading volume over the past 7
and 30 days, denoted \texttt{volume\_7d} and \texttt{volume\_30d},
respectively.

\textbf{\texttt{turn}}. Turnover, computed as the last day's trading
volume over the current market capitalization (e.g.,
\citeproc{ref-datarLiquidityStock1998}{Datar et al., 1998}).

\textbf{\texttt{turn\_7d}}. Average turnover over the past 7 days.

\textbf{\texttt{std\_turn}}. The standard deviation of the turnover over
the past 30 days.

\textbf{\texttt{std\_vol}}. The log standard deviation of trading volume
over the past 30 days.

\textbf{\texttt{cv\_vol}}. The coefficient of variation is the standard
deviation of the daily trading volume divided by its mean, over the past
30 days (e.g., \citeproc{ref-babiakVariationsTrading2022}{Babiak \&
Erdis, 2022}).

\subsubsection{Liquidity}\label{liquidity}

\textbf{\texttt{bidask}}. The cryptocurrency bid-ask spread, computed
from OHCL prices using the approximation of Ardia et al.
(\citeproc{ref-bidask}{2024}).

\textbf{\texttt{illiq}}. The Amihud
(\citeproc{ref-amihudIlliquidityStock2002}{2002}) price impact
(illiquidity) measure, computed as the 90-day average of the ratio of
the absolute daily return to daily trading volume.

\textbf{\texttt{sat}}. The standardized abnormal turnover, following
Garfinkel et al. (\citeproc{ref-garfinkelDisagreementReturns}{n.d.}).
The measure is calculated as the last day's turnover minus its average
over the past 30 days, divided by the turnover's standard deviation over
the same 30-day period.

\textbf{\texttt{dto}}. De-trended turnover (e.g.,
\citeproc{ref-garfinkelMeasuringInvestors2009}{Garfinkel, 2009}). It is
computed as turnover minus the value-weighted average daily market
turnover, de-trended by its 180-day median.

\textbf{\texttt{volsh\_*d}}. Volume shock, defined as the log-deviation
of daily trading volume from its \(k\)-day rolling average (e.g.,
\citeproc{ref-llorenteDynamicVolumeReturn2002}{Llorente et al., 2002}).
For \texttt{volsh\_15d} and \texttt{volsh\_30d}, \(k = 15\) and
\(k = 30\), respectively. For cryptocurrency \(i\) at time \(t\):

\[
v_{i,t} = \log(\text{Volume}_{i,t}) - \log\left( \frac{1}{k} \sum_{s=1}^{k} \text{Volume}_{i,t-s} \right)
\]

\subsubsection{Past returns}\label{past-returns}

\textbf{\texttt{r2\_1}}. Daily reversal, defined as the previous day's
cryptocurrency return.

\textbf{\texttt{r*\_1}}. The 7, 14, 21, and 30-day momentum, denoted
\texttt{r7\_1}, \texttt{r14\_1}, \texttt{r21\_1}, and \texttt{r30\_1},
respectively. Momentum is defined as the cumulative return from the
previous \(k \in \{7, 14, 21, 30\}\) days up to one day before the
return prediction.

\textbf{\texttt{r30\_14}}. Cumulative return from the previous 30 days
up to 14 days before the return prediction.

\textbf{\texttt{r180\_60}}. Cumulative return from the previous 180 days
up to 60 days before the return prediction.

\textbf{\texttt{alpha}}. The CAPM alpha, defined as the intercept from a
30-day rolling regression of cryptocurrency's excess returns on the
market portfolio excess returns. The market portfolio is constructed as
in \texttt{beta}.

\subsubsection{Distribution}\label{distribution}

\textbf{\texttt{skew\_*d}}. Skewness of daily returns over the previous
7 and 30 days, denoted \texttt{skew\_7d} and \texttt{skew\_30d},
respectively.

\textbf{\texttt{kurt\_*d}}. Kurtosis of daily returns over the previous
7 and 30 days, denoted \texttt{kurt\_7d} and \texttt{kurt\_30d},
respectively.

\textbf{\texttt{maxret\_*d}}. The maximum daily return over the past 7
and 30 days, denoted \texttt{maxret\_7d} and \texttt{maxret\_30d},
respectively.

\textbf{\texttt{minret\_*d}}. The minimum daily return over the past 7
and 30 days, denoted \texttt{minret\_7d} and \texttt{minret\_30d},
respectively.

\section{Observable risk factors}\label{sec-obs_factors}

Following Y. Liu et al. (\citeproc{ref-liuCommonRisk2022}{2022}), I
construct a daily cryptocurrency market return as the value-weighted
average return of all the cryptocurrencies in the sample. For
cryptocurrencies \(i = 1, ..., N\), the daily market return at time
\(t\) is computed as:

\[
r_t^M = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N r_{it} \cdot marketcap_{it}}
             {\sum_{i=1}^N marketcap_{it} }
\]

The cryptocurrency market excess return is constructed as the difference
between the cryptocurrency market return and the risk-free rate. To
proxy the risk-free rate, I used the (daily) 1-month Treasury bill rate
from the FRED.
