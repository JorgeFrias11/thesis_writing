# Abstract {.unnumbered .unlisted}

In this thesis, I study whether a set of risk factors explain the variation of cryptocurrency returns and their compensation to risk exposure. Using the Instrumented Principal Component Analisys model of @kellyCharacteristicsAre2019, I estimate latent factor models from a large panel of cryptocurrency characteristics that instrument for the unobservable time-varying loadings. I show that the IPCA performs better in-and out-of-sample compared to a traditional static model with observable risk factors. I show that a two latent factor model suffices to estimate a considerable amount of risk compensation, but the returns dynamics are better explained with additional latent factors. Moreover,
