## Cryptocurrency Characteristics {#sec-app_characteristics}

Following @bianchiMispricingRiskCompensation2021, @liuCommonRisk2022, and @mercikCrosssectionalInteractionsCryptocurrency2025, I construct 41 asset-specific characteristics from OHCL prices, volume, and market capitalization of each cryptocurrency and group them into six categories: prize and size, volatility and risk, trading activity, liquidity, past returns, and distribution. The following list provides the definition of each characteristic and a description of their construction. 


#### Price and size

**`mcap`**. Last day's market capitalization. The market capitalization is the current cryptocurrency circulating supply multiplied by its current price in USD. 

**`prc`**. Last day's logged closing price. 

**`dh90`**. The closeness to the 90-day high is defined as the ratio of the last dayâ€™s price to the maximum price observed over the past 90 days [e.g., @george52WeekHigh2004].

#### Volatility and risk

**`beta`**. The market beta is calculated as the slope coefficient from a 30-day rolling regression of cryptocurrency's excess returns on the market portfolio excess returns [e.g., @lewellenConditionalCAPM2006]. The coin market portfolio is constructed daily as the value-weighted average of cryptocurrency returns in the sample.

**`ivol`**. Idiosyncratic volatility  is computed as the standard deviation of the residuals from the 30-day rolling CAPM regression, following the same approach as for `beta`. 

**`rvol_*d`**. Realized volatility, computed using the estimator of Yang and Zhang (2000) based on OHCL prices. I compute the daily realized volatility over rolling 7-and 30-day windows, denoted `rvol_7d` and `rvol_30d`, respectively. For $n > 1$ number of periods, the volatility estimate at time $t$ is:  

$$
\sigma_t = \sqrt{\sigma^2_O + k\sigma^2_C + (1 - k)\sigma^2_{RS}}
$$
where $\sigma^2_{RS}$ is the variance estimator of Rogers et al. (1994), and $\sigma^2_O$, $\sigma^2_C$, $k$ are given by 

$$
\sigma^2_O = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(o_i - \bar o)^2,
$$

$$
\sigma^2_C = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n(c_i - \bar c)^2,
$$

$$
k = \frac{\alpha -1}{\alpha + \frac{n+1}{n-1}}
$$

with $o = ln\,O_t - ln\,C_{t-1}$, and $c = ln\,C_t - ln\,O_t$. Here, $C_{t-1}$ denotes the previous day's closing price and $O_t$ the current day's opening price. I set the constant $\alpha = 1.34$, following Yang and Zhang (2000), who recommend this as the best value in practice.  


**`retvol`**. Standard deviation of daily returns over the past 7 days [e.g., @angCrossSectionVolatility2006].

**`var`**. The historical Value-at-Risk at the 5% level, based on daily returns over the past 90 days. 

**`es_5`**. The expected shortfall at the 5% level, based on daily returns over the past 90 days. 

**`delay`**. From the regression
$$
R_i - R_f = \alpha^i + \beta^i_{CMKT}CMKT + \beta^i_{CMKT_{-1}}CMKT_{-1} + \beta^i_{CMKT_{-2}}CMKT_{-2} + \epsilon_i, 
$$ 
where $R_i$ is the return on asset $i$, $R_f$ is the risk-free rate, and $CMKT$, $CMKT_{-1}$, and $CMKT_{-2}$ are the current, lagged one-and two-day coin market portfolio excess returns, `delay` is the improvement in $R^2$ relative to the standard CAPM regression using only the current market portfolio excess returns [e.g., @houMarketFrictions2005]. The coin market portfolio is constructed as in `beta`.


#### Trading activity

**`volume`**. Last day's daily trading volume. The trading volume is the total amount of a cryptocurrency exchanged in a given day, measured in USD.

**`volume_*d`**. The average trading volume over the past 7 and 30 days, denoted `volume_7d` and `volume_30d`, respectively. 

**`turn`**. Turnover, computed as the last day's trading volume over the current market capitalization [e.g., @datarLiquidityStock1998].

**`turn_7d`**. Average turnover over the past 7 days. 


**`std_turn`**. The standard deviation of the turnover over the past 30 days. 

**`std_vol`**. The log standard deviation of trading volume over the past 30 days.

**`cv_vol`**. The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation of the daily trading volume divided by its mean, over the past 30 days [e.g., @babiakVariationsTrading2022]. 

#### Liquidity

**`bidask`**. The cryptocurrency bid-ask spread, computed from OHCL prices using the approximation of @bidask. 

**`illiq`**. The @amihudIlliquidityStock2002  price impact (illiquidity) measure, computed as the 90-day average of the ratio of the absolute daily return to daily trading volume.

**`sat`**. The standardized abnormal turnover, following @garfinkelDisagreementReturns. The measure is calculated as the last day's turnover minus its average over the past 30 days, divided by the turnover's standard deviation over the same 30-day period.

**`dto`**. De-trended turnover [e.g., @garfinkelMeasuringInvestors2009]. It is computed as turnover minus the value-weighted average daily market turnover, de-trended by its 180-day median.

**`volsh_*d`**. Volume shock, defined as the log-deviation of daily trading volume from its $k$-day rolling average [e.g., @llorenteDynamicVolumeReturn2002]. For `volsh_15d` and `volsh_30d`, $k = 15$ and $k = 30$, respectively. For cryptocurrency $i$ at time $t$:

$$
v_{i,t} = \log(\text{Volume}_{i,t}) - \log\left( \frac{1}{k} \sum_{s=1}^{k} \text{Volume}_{i,t-s} \right)
$$

### Past returns

**`r2_1`**. Daily reversal, defined as the previous day's cryptocurrency return. 

**`r*_1`**. The 7, 14, 21, and 30-day momentum, denoted `r7_1`, `r14_1`, `r21_1`, and `r30_1`, respectively. Momentum is defined as the cumulative return from the previous $k \in \{7, 14, 21, 30\}$ days up to one day before the return prediction.  

**`r30_14`**. Cumulative return from the previous 30 days up to 14 days before the return prediction. 

**`r180_60`**. Cumulative return from the previous 180 days up to 60 days before the return prediction.

**`alpha`**. The CAPM alpha, defined as the intercept from a 30-day rolling regression of cryptocurrency's excess returns on the market portfolio excess returns. The market portfolio is constructed as in `beta`.

### Distribution

**`skew_*d`**. Skewness of daily returns over the previous 7 and 30 days, denoted `skew_7d` and `skew_30d`, respectively. 

**`kurt_*d`**. Kurtosis of daily returns over the previous 7 and 30 days, denoted `kurt_7d` and `kurt_30d`, respectively. 

**`maxret_*d`**. The maximum daily return over the past 7 and 30 days, denoted `maxret_7d` and `maxret_30d`, respectively. 

**`minret_*d`**. The minimum daily return over the past 7 and 30 days, denoted `minret_7d` and `minret_30d`, respectively.
